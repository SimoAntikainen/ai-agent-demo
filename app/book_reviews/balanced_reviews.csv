Set in the future, in a time where fireman burn books for a living, we see played out the story of a man named Montag who is a fireman....but he knows there's more to life...... Befriended by a sixteen year old girl named Clarrise Mclellan, he begins to see through her eyes the beauty of simple nature. And books come alive to him. He later comes to himself and quits his job as a fireman. Although this is a Science Fiction it has a depth that this genre often lacks. Montag's wife is distant from him. Clarrise who was like a daughter to him was killed. And in the end being an outcast joins a group of men who believe in a brighter future. This book is not only important to read but moving. Put it up there with Brave New World and 1984.I have a great appreciation for good litreture. Being a future writer myself, I believe good writers are always good readers.",['Ray Bradbury'],

You missed a major theme of the very book you're trashing: society has degraded because thinking was deemed &quot;too much work&quot; - challenging books are burned, and mindless entertainment keeps people docile.Either you didn't really read it, or you haven't learned to think for yourself yet. (And only those under 20 get to use the latter excuse.)You don't have to like this book. You don't need to agree with everything Mr. Bradbury says. BUT - if you didn't like it because it required too much work from you... well, let's just say you shouldn't be proud of that fact. Everyone who &quot;got&quot; this book, whether they liked it or not, understands this.And to the book burning eighth grader...

This, sadly prophetic, book truly reflects modern day life. Amazingly, people don't read anymore, BY CHOICE! Were offended by any and all things serious. Life has become nothing but trivial, meaningless, stupid, &quot;fun.&quot; The movies, television, pastimes, everything, is completely empty and devoid of all substance, if it actually has a point, then it's called &quot;overly serious.&quot; After all, we just want to &quot;have fun;&quot; why waste our lives trying to fix problems? Forget the problems! Life's too short! Eat, drink, tomorrow we may die! Ozone depletion, global warming? Bah! Human beings like you and I starving to death? I don't see it! Poverty, pollution, living beyond our means, injustice, racism, classism, sexism, hatred of all differences, greed, and countless other serious problems? Who cares, I don't see 'em! Flick on the TV!... and all these other anoexic, empty-headed, cuties we all aspire to be, who have nothing to offer us but &quot;cute-ness,&quot; and, of course, the planned obsolesence of the latest clothing fads, etc!How have we gone this far over the edge? Why don't we read? Why don't we care? Why don't we think? Why do we allow this to go on? Ray Bradbury tackles all these questions and more in his book. While this isn't a difficult book to read, it is slow reading, because, to get the point, you must continually stop reading and think about what you've read, to ask the important questions: Is it better to know, or not to know? Is it better to read, or not to read? Why do I read? Why do I think? How do I separate two conflicting truths, which are equally true? Join Montag, Clarisse, Faber, Beatty, Stoneman and Black, Mildrid, Granger, and the other characters of Fahrenheit 451 to help you find these answers.What a great book!",['Ray Bradbury'],

But, paradoxically, his mission is NOT to quench fires, but to set them up in order to burn books. Because in the world in which Montag lives, it is absolutely forbidden to read books. Because reading books forces one to think for oneself. And thinking for oneself might lead you to question the world and not be happy. And in this world, it is mandatory to be happy.This book warns about the dangers of a mechanized civilization which condemns the life of the spirit and the free mind. The prescience of Bradbury is remarkable: in a book written in the fifties, he foresaw the terribly negative effects TV could have. Today, there still are free thinkers in this world, but to most people they seem weird and strange. TV, of course, can be used for constructive purposes, but let's be honest and admit that some 90% of its consequences have been stupidly destructive. So turn off your Oprah (like she could recommend good literature) and read this book: you'll end up wanting to read more.",['Ray Bradbury'],

This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.,['Ray Bradbury'],

A Must Read !,"How many times have you ever wished that you never ever have to read another book again or how many times have you wished that books should be banned so that you could watch the TV all day long? Well, enter into Ray Bradbury's world where reading books are illegal, watching TV all day is encouraged and running people over with cars are acceptable.Remember in school, where the brainy kids would always answer the teacher's questions while the rest of us sat behind? The rest of us would always feel dumber and after class we would beat up the brainy kids. It was a no win situation but in this wonderful society, class consisted of - you guessed it - television and more television. But in this world, everyone was made equal, so much equality that practically everyone are mindless zombies.Guy Montag, the protagonist of FAHRENHEIT 451, mindlessly burn books for a living. His profession is being a fireman. What better way to prevent books from making us unhappy, right? Wrong! Everyone that follows the contraband-book-society is miserable. Right off the first few pages, someone wants to kill herself and it turns out to be Montag's wife.Clarisse McClellan enters the picture and she gives Montag a little shove towards the direction of actually making him think for himself. For a moment there, Montag starts to live. He sees nature meaning trees and flowers, you know, that sort of junk people really don't see when their mind and concentration is on the television. McClellan also makes Montag question his lifestyle and happiness. He starts to get upset because he realizes that there is something terribly wrong with how the society works. But don't worry. Before McClellan can complete the transformation of making Montag into a living and breathing person, she gets run over by a car, driven by a bunch of kids. A wonderful world, is it not?Since Montag is stuck in between the phase of being a zombie and being a full fledge person, he looks for help. Although he wants help, he's placing himself in danger, by - be prepared for this - reading books and by talking with Faber, a retired English professor. The journey that awaits Montag would be full of confusion, danger and anger especially when Faber and Beatty have a verbal one-on-one. By the way, Beatty is really Captain Beatty, as in captain of the fire department.",['Ray Bradbury'],

In Montag's world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on &quot;Seashell Radio&quot; sets attached to their ears.Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan , who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literatur. The woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that a speeding car has killed Clarisse.Montag's dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent. When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it's normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place.According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other &quot;minorities&quot; objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society, as a whole, decided to simply burn books rather than permit a conflicting opinion.",['Ray Bradbury'],
0003300277,Fahrenheit 451 (Cascades S.),,A3UUDIH2ZTFSXJ,Sir Timothy Newman,0/0,3.0,1074124800,"Mrs. Spehar, please give me an A+","If you have ever heard the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;, you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read by my mom after she read the reading list Mrs. Spehar gave us, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book where I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands.",['Ray Bradbury'],

People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree with them or not. First off it's about a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job is not to fight fire and put it out but to start the fires. At this time books are forbidden from people unless they were government writings. That is how the government controlled them: by not letting them learn. Although one day he can't help but read a line from one of the books he is about to burn. Of course he becomes curious and steals some books so that he can read them for himself. After starting to read the books he goes to an old professor to see if they can reprint some of these books. One night he came to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection. The fire captain drowns her books in kerosene except the old woman lights herself on fire along with her books. After seeing this Montag becomes disgusted and decides not to be a fireman any longer. Montag decides to go to work for just one more day and surprisingly they get a call to go to his house where he is the one to light his house on fire. Instead of lighting a match he kills the other men and goes on the run eventually meeting up with a group of old college professors in the woods and eventually becoming one of them.I disliked this book for a few reasons. The first one is because it is a futuristic book it is hard to follow in some places and the author describes some things in a way that is very difficult to understand.The reasons I liked this book is the fact that you have to create what you think the author is trying to make the future look like; and because Bradbury is a very descriptive writer he helps you create a picture of what you are reading. Another reason I liked this book is because I can relate to it. The people in our society are reading less and enjoying television and radios more than they should be.",['Ray Bradbury'],
0003300277,Fahrenheit 451 (Cascades S.),,,,0/0,3.0,1098748800,Fahrenheit 451.,"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to ""Seashell Radio"" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The ""normal"" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose ""family"" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books ""treacherous weapons,"" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the ""Book People,"" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste.",['Ray Bradbury'],

This stuff is good, written in 1953, even if you are like me and don't like science fiction. Pass on those Bush-bashing movies by disingenuous poorly dressed film-makers and go to the real thing.This Fahrenheit is called 451 because that is the temperature at which books burn, more or less, and that is what this is about. Reminiscent of Hitlerian Germany, book burning is back in vogue in the eastern US in the late 20th century. The first ironic twist is that the firemen start the fires to burn the books, generally engulfing the book owner's home, and sometimes the book owner as well.Guy Montag is a third generation fireman who starts to question the purpose and meaning in burning books. All homes have been somehow fireproofed, so no real fires occur, only those started by the fire department. Montag's wife sits home all day, watching mindless broadcasts on large screens, and complaining that Guy needs to earn more money in order to purchase even larger screens. Her ultimate objective is to cover all four walls of the living room with monitors.Guy starts to sneak home some of the books and of course, he ultimately becomes the target of his own department. He learns that he should not trust his wife or his colleagues, all of whom long ago drank the kool-aid. He does make the acquaintance of an elderly professor, an intellectual and scholar from the old days, who ultimately puts him in touch with others of a similar ilk.Perhaps most interesting is the reason givien for burning the books. Non-fiction is bad, since it is all contradictory and impossible to prove, and fiction is even worse since it is not even true, just made-up people, places, and dialogue. And dont get me started on poetry or philosophy, that will only cause confusion, sorrow, and feelings of being lost. Society has made a clear selection in its entertainment, with an absolute preference for high speed sports, action, and adventure.More irony follows as Montag on several occasions becomes both the observer and the target as he is pursued by the authorities. Then we learn from reading a book that books are not a suitable way for humanity to store knowledge, that requires dedicated but powerless and marginalized scholars involved in constant peer review and analysis. The last irony is that Bradbury has written a very short book here, actually a novella, because he knows that we prefer action and adventure to reading.As of this 2005 writing, I understand that Bradbury is in his 80's and still working. In various interviews, he expressed anger that Michael Moore would adapt his title for a completely unrelated and unfunny diatribe. But then, Bradbury lifted ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" right out of Shakespeare. What comes around, goes around.",['Ray Bradbury'],

In Fahrenheit 451 the way that Ray Bradbury uses his imagination to visualize the future is great. His future had shells for head phones and walls for screens, that is so cool. Except for the fact that everyone has lost there mind the story is extremely interesting.The way that Mr. Bradbury depicts the future is almost real in the sense that what if we really do forget what books are used for. The way that Montag gets interested in the books and has to try to hide it from every one he knows.The detail that Bradbury goes in to about Montag keeping his secret is great describing him sweating out every second. Mildred At all times being half drugged half awake. The society to wear no one can die unless you have books then you are burned. I believe that Bradbury succeeded in is book although I believe it is increasingly weird.It gives brilliant depiction into his mind and his imagination.

Ray Bradbury, the author of the book, tells his vision of the future which is definitly technology enhanced.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who loves fire. In this time it is firemens job to start fire to a house of those who have disobeyed the law, like possesing a book. The people of this society are to think the same and to know of no different. Guy Montag is of course one of these people. However this soon changes when he meets a young girl names Clarisse who is quick to change Montags beliefs.Montag begins to realize that that book burning is wrong and the thing that he loves burning is the very thing that spreads knowledge and opinion. After he realizes this he is tempted to steal one of his own. He does this and the plot begins to unfold. He tells his wife of his secret and that he actually has stolen many more. His wife disagrees with him that this is the right thing to do and turns him in. Guy Montag meets new people along the way that have the same opinion about this stuff and they help him. Montag tries to rebuild his society with new freedoms after it is destroyed in war.I enjoyed this book becase Bradbury's descriptions and vocabulary usages are amazing. I liked how he showed that the things we think so little of are really very important to the life and freedoms that we have today. He also shows that sometimes inventions can get out of control and we forget how to do the simple things becase the machines do it for us. The author creates a world that is threatening and exotic but at the same time is is familiar enough to seem real.

0003300277,Fahrenheit 451 (Cascades S.),,,,4/6,5.0,1168128000,Superb!,"To verify, I am a boy of age twelve. For a little introduction before delving into my review of this book, I would like to say that I amuse myself with books more advanced for my age, as they are by far more interesting, and enhance my writing skills and whatnot. With that done, I will not begin my comments on the book and a bit of a summary.Concise Summary (in my standards): Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, concentrates on a man by the name of Guy Montag, living perhaps a century or so from modern day, when the world suddenly altered into a dystopia. Therefore, firemen, instead of extinguishing fire, generate fire. However, they perform such tasks because of certain objects: books. Books were thought to be threatening and complicated, and thus, were ordered to be destroyed. The entire history of firemen was completely changed to fit this. For example, Benjamin Franklin was the first fireman, but he was a fireman parallel to that of the world in Fahrenheit 451.Anyway, Guy Montag is happy with his life. Until he discovers a girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan, who forces upon intricate thoughts about the past. Certainly, she was an odd person. Later on, she disappears, possibly dying. However, despite this, she remains an impact to Montag, influencing him. By time, Montag betrays the society and becomes an avid book-reader. The tale journeys through a short, almost unbelievable period of Montag's life, twisting into the end with Montag joining a group of book fanatics whom memorized certain books.Comments: The story is interesting, unlike any book I've ever read. Instead of being based on the normal spaceship, out-of-the-world concept, it is based on a completely different world, frighteningly similar to ours in a way. Bradbury employs nice words, but does not suddenly place a difficult one right out of nowhere. Because of this, the flow is great.The writing style is at least normal, as it should be with most authors. The plot is overall good, although I do feel that everything occurs too quickly. In a week or so, Montag changes from a ten-year fireman to a book lover. Regardless, it is a good book.",['Ray Bradbury'],

It is a profound, pivoting novel, redolent of dysthymic admonitions and insight into the depths of nature. We are truly moving closer to the future allocuted by Ray Bradbury, for we reside in a society of superficiality and vice, in which mass media precludes critical thought and engages in unmitigable ideological insemination. The infernal machine known as the television is everywhere, and the pretense of the machine's adoration of the viewer and pseudo-relationship manifests itself in the aplomb, homogenous you-centered advertising schemes. Political correctness is bilious and has reached a prodigious, nauseous height. We are absorbed in a sub-culture of vanity, asininity, and conformance, whilst the circumambient ecumenical situation continues to precipitate. But we can preclude the advent of a Bradburian future. We must destroy televisions everywhere, and rid the world of superficiality. degenerate literature such as modern romances and John Grisham should stop being idolized, and we must return to the antecedental genius of man, We must read Thackery, Bronte, Joyce, Mann, Goethe, Kant, and we must liberate ourselves from ignorance. reading this, i felt that Clarisse Mclellan was predicated upon me. I have always wandered amongst fecund leas and orchards and the fallow moors, engrossed in nature, and admonished and mocked for it. Just the other day, whilst seeing the reflection of a television's promulgations, i heard jets in the sky, their aquiline screech shattering the heterogenous tranquility of the pines diademed with mists of the sea... and all the while, the television blasted, and i thought eerily of Fahrenheit 451, and what would ensue....",['Ray Bradbury'],
0003300277,Fahrenheit 451 (Cascades S.),,ARUE2BHA15ID5,"Twilightdreamlover ""Mariangeles""",2/3,5.0,1281312000,"Brilliant, depressing, electrifying, profound!!","Ray Bradbury's books make for immediate, mesmerizing, entirely compulsive reading. His prose is electrifying in its use of poetic metaphor and dramatic syntax. The reader is instantly plunged into an alien culture, or a terrifying future, and is not really released even after the last page is turned.I had been postponing reading this novel for years. I am, after all, a confirmed bibliophile. Reading a novel with a plot involving the burning of books would, I kept telling myself, be too traumatic for me.I finally decided to wade in.Need I say that I only put the book down when I absolutely had to, when reality intruded? The novel carried me along on its relentless wave of narrative. Of course, I tried not to picture the books burning as I read, but Bradbury wouldn't let me. Not when he was describing them as living creatures, dying, their pigeon wings flapping.... The fact that I managed to endure this at all is a real tribute to the greatness of his writing.The characters are indelibly imprinted on my brain. The most compelling, of course, is the protagonist, Montag. Equally compelling are Faber, who is obviously Montag's alter ego, and the numinous Clarisse. She is the one who first awakens Montag to the futility of denying his own soul, the stirrings of thought and penetrating questions that reading invariably arouses. The most tragic character is Beatty, who struggles hard against his love of books, in his work as chief fireman. This struggle culminates in a final, ironic conflagration. Montag's wife, Mildred, is to be pitied, since she is unable to acknowledge her emptiness, her consuming loneliness. She pushes away the power and beauty to be found in books. She refuses to come out of denial, preferring `the family', a banal cast of characters she endlessly watches on the living room `wall-to-wall TV', in order to anesthetize the deepest longings of her soul.As I read, I became aware of a deeper sense of discomfort, underneath that elicited by the burning of books. Due to my own life experiences, I, along with this disturbed society, had been unconsciously longing for a world in which no one would ever get his or her feelings hurt - a world where everyone's rights would be respected, especially those of minorities.Bradbury gave me a sobering look at such a world, and it was absolutely terrifying. It was ""American Idol"" gone wild, a world in which people no longer thought, felt, or even communicated on a soul level with other human beings. Instead, they spent all their time being `happy', through mindless, ongoing entertainment.I realized that I didn't want to live in such a world; it would mean the total annihilation of what makes us most deeply human - the ability to dream, to wonder, to ponder the deep truths of life.Books and the questions they raise are incompatible with living in a world where nobody would offend anyone else. Books disturb, probe, anger and challenge. Books are flawed at times, due to their authors' all-too-human penchant for furthering their own pet theories, however twisted they might seem to a reader. Books can make us squirm, for they can force us to face the unwanted realities we try to bury.There is still a part of me that thinks that books such as ""Mein Kampf"" should be burned, or at least, allowed to expire by going, and staying, out of print. The Marquis de Sade also comes to mind as an author of books with a markedly offensive subject matter. Then there's Anais Nin. One of her books chronicles the incestuous relationship she had with her father...The problem is, where do you draw the line? Who decides which books merit extinction?I don't have a final, satisfactory answer.And so I am left feeling restless and slightly depressed, although I'm glad to have read the book, nevertheless. It has caused me to ponder what I really and truly believe regarding the banning of books, and their potentially harmful influences.Yet another uncomfortable element of the plot is Montag's desperate, evil act toward the end of the novel. I suppose it is inevitable, however. It is indeed immoral, but then, so is the entire, nihilistic society he is a part of. It is the act of a man who has turned on a symbol of that society, and so, turned on himself, in a sense, in order to be reborn as a new man, a man who thinks and feels, even if doing so causes him some measure of unhappiness. This act could, itself, be considered a harmful influence on a reader, since Montag evades punishment. Yet, as an act of rebellion, of a misplaced sort of justice, it is totally fitting. Therein lies ""the treason of the artist"", as Ursula K. LeGuin puts it. For the artist makes meaning out of pain, suffering, and tragedy. This is also part of the value to be found in books.The symbol of rebirth is ubiquitous in the novel. At one point, the myth of the Phoenix is mentioned. Ironically, civilization is being reborn out of the very fire it has used to destroy the very objects that had given it meaning - books.By the end of the novel, groups of people have quietly begun the reconstruction, the return to reading. It is a movement that is slowly gathering momentum. Civilization, suggests Bradbury, as Miller's ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" was to do years later, is constantly rising from the ashes of every Dark Age in order to reinvent itself.So I know that I will be re-reading this book sometime in the near future, as I intend to do with Miller's. Both are books that apparently dwell on despair, only to end with a feeling of hope.Bradbury has once again sparked my imagination and tickled my intellect. He also refuses to let me forget his incredible take on a future that may or may not turn out to become all too real.",['Ray Bradbury'],

So, like always, I'll just give my personal insights. In my opinion, what makes a classic a classic is something like this. . .it's pretty obvious that this book, when it was written, takes place in the future. Never do we know exactly when, and never is it actually stated that this book takes place in the future, yet it is. The fact that the fictional plot isn't really far-fetched is spooky, and mabe that's what caused such a stir when this book was causing controversy.Another thing is that a classic can not be defined as just one genre. This book is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. It's not the sci-fi that Asimov presents, where it takes place in space, across planets and galaxies and so on (by the way, I like Asimov alot, I'm not at all saying this type of sci-fi is bad), but with the little details, such as a Mechanical Hound (who was quite intimidating I might add), and the seashell worn by Mildred. It was more science fiction than I expected it to be, yet it was far from just a science fiction novel. It is also mostly a dystopian novel, yet at times it's also a thriller, even a tad of horror, and not to mention some heavy pyschological tendicies. And all of it works beautifully together.This story also does two things that a classic does: it takes a toll, or has a profound effect, on you, and also gets you thinking. From early on, and I mean the very first pages, the mood is dark and gloomy, and already the reader feels dreary. Montag's unhappiness is so realistic, his world so seemingly hopeless. Instantly the reader pities and sympathizes with Montag. His unhappiness, his refusal to just do as he's told like everyone around him does, is so well written as to be completely relatable and realistic. The scene where he watches his wife being ""operated on"" after she overdoses is both intense and horrific.It's pretty amazing that this book was so controversial and so challenged, especially considering the plot. Bradbury fit a whole lot of story into 150 pages here, and whatever he was trying to accomplish, I'd say he was extremely successful. Something Wicked This Way Comes was a good book, a really fun read (one thing I really liked better about fahrenheit 451 is that Bradbury's writing is much more concise) but THIS book is the real deal, and this is what proved to me that Bradbury deserves the praise and accolades he received throughout his lifetime. One of the best books I've read and I certainly recommend you read it.",['Ray Bradbury'],
0003300277,Fahrenheit 451 (Cascades S.),,AJ98YA4Y333BK,"CJA ""CJA""",0/0,4.0,1361145600,Intriguing and Still Relevant,"Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia.",['Ray Bradbury'],

Now, from everything I knew about this book before I read it, I thought the novel was going to be a great love story full of romance and hugging and declarations of devotion. Boy, was I wrong. At the heart of the book is a revenge drama carried out by a man so consumed by hatred that he makes Palpatine from the first Star Wars trilogy look like a nice guy.Heathcliff was raised from childhood with Catherine Earnshaw and her older brother Hindley, but Heathcliff was not related to them. Mr. Earnshaw brought Heathcliff home with him one day after finding him living the life of an orphan on the streets of London. I kinda suspect that maybe Heathcliff was a secret love child Earnshaw had with a mistress in the city. But that's just my take. Heathcliff rapidly becomes Earnshaw's favorite, even more so than Hindley, much to the son's disgust, which fuels an intense hatred and jealousy that only gets worse after the elder Earnshaw dies. Up to that point, Heathcliff had always been treated as a member of the family, but afterwards Hindley treats him as nothing more than a common servant to be abused and made to work his hands to the bone. And by abused, I do mean actual physical beatings. Catherine, the great love of Heathcliff's life, decides that he has nothing to offer her and instead marries Edgar Linton, the son of one of their neighbors. Hindley too, gets married. The only one left out of this whole lovefest is, you guessed it, Heathcliff, and he leaves the windswept moors only to return years later to exact his revenge on both families Monte Cristo style.I was really caught off guard by this book. Like I said, I was expecting a romance instead of a Shakespearean revenge tragedy. That's not to say there isn't a happy ending, but that it takes a long and convoluted path, wrought with broken lives and bittersweet death. What turns Heathcliff into such a monster is that both he and Catherine know that they were meant to be together but she makes the decision to reject him based solely on improving her social standing. And let's be frank, the supposed social mobility she craves doesn't amount to squat when you live out in the middle of nowhere in some backwater Gothic swamp. To me, I can almost see precursors to Faulkner's decaying nobility. Something else that really struck me about the novel was its haunting theme of sexual frustration. What Heathcliff and Catherine feel for each other is very sexual. There isn't any idealistic or poetic flowers growing out of each other's imagination. They see each other for what they are and love each other for what they are. Neither of them were cannibals but I almost felt like if they could find a way to eat each other, they would have.Bronte does a virtuoso job of moving between time periods and showing different generations of the Earnshaws and Lintons as the children of both have to deal with the legacy left them by the destructive failed love of Catherine and Heathcliff. The main narrators of the story are not the two main characters. Instead, the tale is told by Nelly, a maid just a little older than them who was a witness to everything that happened. She tells the story to a certain Mr. Lockwood, a man who is renting a house from Heathcliff many years after all this has gone down. Emily moves from present to past to future and back again during different chapters that really seems a more postmodern way of looking at things. This book was far ahead of its time in terms of novelistic technique.Bronte even takes up the issue of racism in Wuthering Heights, as part of the reason Hindley and the Lintons look down on Heathcliff is because of his ""dark gipsy skin"".I look at Catherine as a coward who recognized that Heathcliff was who she was meant to be with, but in her superficial thinking, she was more worried about marrying well (weren't all women of that time the same) than marrying for love. Marrying for love was for peasants. If you had money or land you had to marry an equal or someone higher than you. She chose wrongly and a lot of people had to suffer for it.",['Emily Bronte'],

I fell in love with Emily Bronte and her cadence of language from the very first chapter.Sadly, I loathed the characters. I sympathized with Heathcliff in the first half of the book and was disappointed to find myself hating him in the second half. I despised Catherine Earnshaw from her introduction in the story until her death. The only character I liked at all was Hareton, and I was happy for the way things turned out for him.Reading Wuthering Heights made me appreciate Jane Austen so much more than I already did! Emily Bronte's female characters continually made me wistfully think of Austen's Elizabeth Bennett, and long for her to inhabit Thrushcross Grange instead of Catherine Earnshaw. The difference between Austen's female characters and Bronte's is shocking. I definitely take the existence of strong willed women in modern fiction for granted, and this reminded me how ahead of her time Jane Austen really was. I would love to read a piece of Austen fanfic in which Elizabeth Bennet bashes Catherine Earnshaw over the head with a frying pan, usurps her as mistress of Thrushcross Grange, and gives Heathcliff AND Mr. Linton a sound thrashing.I was surprised that some describe this story as romantic; I didn't find one word even remotely romantic! I appreciated the Gothic and supernatural elements and the wonderful, descriptive writing style. I have a beautiful image of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights in my head; I can picture the houses and their rooms, the landscape, the gardens and the hills. Despite the personalities of the characters, I really did enjoy this story and I'm glad to have finally read it.I especially love this new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition.

0140351310,Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics),,,,6/7,4.0,916876800,Romance and Mystery Collide!,"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations.",['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']

At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have.",['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']

Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced ""air"") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another).

I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!",['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his ""wife:"" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall. Leaving her belongings in a stage coach by accident, she has no other option other than to become a beggar or die on the streets.She finnally is taken into the Rivers residence. Here St. John, and his 2 sisters care for her, and she becomes like one of the family. She later learns that John Eyre (the uncle from the letter) has died and left Jane his fortune. During this, she learns that the Rivers are her cousins. She shares the fortune with them.St. John repeatedly asks her to marry him and join him as a missionary during her time there. They both know he does not love her, but he thinks Jane would be a good missionary wife.One night, Jane hears Mr. Rochester's voice calling to her, and runs from St. Johns house to Thornfeild Hall. There she finds the estate burned to the ground. Bertha had set fire to it and Mr. Rochester was blinded when he unsuccessfully tried to save her life.Jane and Mr. Rochester, never losing any feelings for each other during their time apart, then marry.",['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']
0140351310,Jane Eyre: Complete and Unabridged (Puffin Classics),,A199V9XYO6JJ9,LGM,8/10,5.0,1136678400,"a Victorian genius in any language, but not for everyone","The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, ""Whoa--where did THAT come from?"" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, ""It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!"" just as the answer to modern western readers is, ""It's wrong but fun--just do it!""This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (""Ghostly happenings"" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!",['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']

It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges.,['Charlote Brontë'],['Fiction']

From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise.

The story starts with George and Lenny working on a farm in a town called 'weed'. George is a very intelligent man and Lenny is a mentally challenged giant. One day while at work, Lenny sees a woman with a red dress on and goes up to talk to her. He gets into trouble when he goes up to her because he does something he should not but does not realize that he is doing anything wrong. He and George then have to run to another farm because they do not want to get caught for what Lenny has done. They need to keep working because their ultimate goal is to own a ranch of their own where Lenny can raise rabbits and they can both live off the 'fatta the lan.' They get to the next ranch the next day and meet the people around there. There is a very nice man, 'Slim', and poor black man and old man, and the worst character of the book, a mean, cocky man, Curley. They work at the farm for a few weeks until Lenny gets in trouble again with an incident similar to the first. The story ends shortly after this and is ended in a very well way. This book is one of the greatest books I have read, not to mention it only being 107 pages long. Steinbeck is a great author and has produced many great books including 'The Grapes of Wrath,' another great novel of his. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be able to read a story in just a short couple of hours. This is the shortest book that I've ever read but also the most touching and realistic book that I've read.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

The fact that people mention the word ""damn"" and ""hell"" with the ocassional insult don't and shouldn't constitute as heavy-duty swearing. It is in no way inappropriate for ninth graders - most ninth graders use far fouler language in everyday life than that mentioned in the book. The way that Crooks is referred to (some prefer to call in the ""n"" word) is not always an insult - it is simply how people called others of different coloring. I just felt that I had to explain my reasons, that's all. Moving on, the book isn't entirely bad. Steinbeck's ideas are convincing, and even though slightly depressing, I (as a reader), felt that they were not expressed entirely well. I found the repetition of certain words, purposeful or not, somewhat badly done. It just did not achieve what could supposedly be the intended effect.The characters could have been described in a much more detailed manner. Since this book was probably written with the goal of a novel easily adapted to theatre, the fact that description was toned down was understandable - but still, it felt very lacking. Though the description used for George and Lennie made it easy to picture the two main characters, again, the repetition of certain words really detracted from the passage as a whole. One thing that gave the novel the impression that it was rushed was the fact that some characters that were introduced in the beginning of the chapter two didn't really play a part later on. For instance, the Boss, Curley's father, seemed to have importance in chapter two, but he faded into obscurity after that. The dialogue, on the other hand, is quite fluid and natural.Even though the conflict in the book was very obvious, it could have been worked on and produced with much more profundity. The ending as it is is powerful on its own, but I can't help but feel that something is missing.All in all, that concludes my review. Please take into account that this is not meant to offend anyone: it is simply my opinion.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it.

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have.

0141804459,Pride & Prejudice (Penguin Classics),,A382MVNP8LF5RG,"Elizabeth Ann Mills ""Avid Reader""",0/0,5.0,1221177600,My Favorite Book,"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, ""[takes] delight in anything ridiculous."" Since the moment I read that infamous line: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged......"" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale ""First Impressions"", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be ""bewitched body and soul"" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated.",['Ibi Zoboi'],['Young Adult Fiction']

0141804459,Pride & Prejudice (Penguin Classics),,A21F73YNVT4PEB,Lindsay Johnson,0/0,5.0,1222905600,A Wonderful Read,"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with ""Pride and Prejudice"" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be ""a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,"" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy.",['Ibi Zoboi'],['Young Adult Fiction']
0141804459,Pride & Prejudice (Penguin Classics),,A116J8AUC3JSN2,"Harkius ""harkius""",0/0,4.0,1223510400,A Nice Novel,"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius",['Ibi Zoboi'],['Young Adult Fiction']

I had the movie running in my mind the entire time I was reading so I was able to compare the movie with the novel. I must say it enhanced the experience. I so loved each time Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy communicated in any way. Just reading their conversations was such a delight. The book really filled in all the conversations that didn't make it into the movie.This story reveals how it is possible to go from hating someone to loving them completely. The journey Elizabeth must go through to love Mr. Darcy is fascinating and complex. There are many letters exchanged and gossip Elizabeth must sort through to find the truth. The reader really feels the hatred she feels and then feels the warming of the heart as each page goes by. Truly this is one of the best romance novels ever written.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""",2/2,5.0,1285372800,"His pride, her prejudice","""Pride and Prejudice"" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (""No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting"").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (""Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do"").Despite its mildly stuffy style, ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

(My mind likes to organise and categorize things). There are the Christian romance authors who explicitly introduce concepts of God and his love for us as they enfold and develop the love story between the main characters. There are the Sex-driven romance authors who give you great details on the physical attraction between the characters and then give you a front row seat (in your imagination of course) to all or some of the sexual experiences in the story. There are the sci-fi based romance authors whose love stories are mystical and many times quite unthinkable. And of course there are the action based romances where the hero is invariably going to end up in some situation (like a fight or car chase) where his machoism will be displayed to the full appreciation of the heroine. And then there are the Historical romance authors who may take any of the aforementioned slants but just given from a historical stand point. Their stories tend to have lot of substance since their work is more often than not well researched and offer detiails and facts of how society and life in general was in the past.Jane Austen's work in Pride and Prejudice falls into none of my categories. You see although she mentions that the characters went to church, she never quite gave us a sermon. Even the value of sex within marriage was the standard of the day and as she dealt with this topic it was in no way an attempt to be ""preachy"". It is not sex-driven for there are no sex scenes and quite frankly many physical details on the characters are missing and instead an overview of the person's features are simply stated as ""Mr. Darcy was tall and handsome"". There was no mysticism or any element of science fiction and the greatest action any of the characters indulged in was taking a walk. The men did not even work hard but rather spent a lot of time reading in their libraries or playing indoor games (like cards). And while we read of carriages and horses and an England of long ago, the truth of the matter is that this is neither the work of a historical romance author because Ms. Austen wrote about her own time and the dependence of women on marriage for economic security and as a means to escape social ridicule and shame. And yet it is a wonderful and probably the best romance story I have ever read (even though I hace not yet categorized it) and not because of its quite ancient philosophies of women but because it is so frank and honest when told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet.It is a pure work of art and Ms. Austen not only transported me to a different time but to a different place and I was amazed at how enthralled I was at this very ""wordy"" books. Yes I love words too but there is a definite art in the way she strung words together with witticism and/or sarcasm for the various dialogue scenes.When held up next to this masterpiece, many modern day romance stories look so immature and hurried.

A few years ago I selected the book to attempt to read it, but I became immediately bored with the literature and tossed it aside, deciding against finishing it.I came across a book claiming to be a sequel of Pride and Prejudice (and a bad sequel I must say) and I decided to give the classic another try.I cannot ascertain why, but this time, something was changed. Before I finished the first chapter, I was completely entranced in the story of the Bennet's and later, Darcy and the Bingelys.At first, I was completely ignorant of the time period's lingo and I was flailing, reading slowly to completely understand the richness of the grand words.

As I go through these reviews I find that hard cover editions, e-books, books on tape, unknown bindings, paperbacks and I don't know what all have all been thrown into the same bag.Let me be perfectly honest and tell you that as far as Austen's work itself, I would give it ten stars if that were possible. This is NOT a review of her work though, rather a review of this particular edition...as stated above. I recently went of a book buying spree for my wife to replace worn out, lost (she is a great loaner of books and many of those loaned books never find there way home), and simply misplaced books. She, like me, is a big Austen fan.Anyway, the Barns and Noble edition book described on this product page is a very fine book when you consider the cost. It is difficult to find a decent paperback book these days, much less a hardback version of anything that does not cost an arm and a leg if bought new.Now so with this printed hard back version. The book is well made. The paper, while not of fine are quality, is certainly nice enough. The binding appears quite good...I know about such things and for a mass produced books this is about as good as you are going to find anywhere. The cost is more than reasonable . (Hey...a supersized extra value meal will cost you more), and font used is extremely readable and easy on the eyes.If you order this book you must pay shipping charges; something to consider. I personally bought mine, along with a number of the `classics' in this series directly at a B&N; store, (We drive to the big city at least every other month), thus saving the cost of S&H.;For a big bang for your buck, I can hardly see how you can go wrong with this one.As to the work itself; if you have not read this one, do so.

So I guess I'd say that it is inconsistent and difficult at times.One thing is that Barcelona is not, in my opinion, nearly as interesting as this book and others make it sound. I tried to spend a month there a couple of years ago and got bored in 10 days.

0143057804,The Shadow of the Wind Bestseller's Choice Audio,,A19IK81WB3QYH1,Gregory Zimmerman,1/1,4.0,1272499200,Literary Labyrinth of Character Connections,"Carlos Ruiz Zafon makes an at-first perplexing choice regarding the structure of his novel The Shadow of the Wind. The plot of this mystery novel has two separate strands; the first is the present-day (well, present-day is 1950s Barcelona) story of Daniel Sempere and his quest to track down the author of the first book he's truly loved. The second is the story of what actually happened to that dashing young novelist named Julian Carax about 30 years before.Instead of telling his story as two separate in-scene, possibly alternating narratives, he tells Daniel's story in the present in first person and the rest of the story in flashback or other non-in-scene devices.So as I traversed the first several hundred pages, I was annoyed -- I'm not a fan of the flashback device anyway, and I was dreading another 400 pages of backwards-looking storytelling. What's more, as I was still meeting the characters, it was hard to know what was truly important and what was just background info. For instance, in the first 100 pages, Daniel falls in love with a blind woman named Clara -- but then Clara quickly exits the novel. And the reader is left to wonder if she's a significant character for something later on or is she only serving as a sort of cautionary tale of unrequited love? Additionally, one of the first flashbacks tells the story of how Julian's parents met, and the early days of their marriage. Important, or not? I had no idea.What does emerge as the novel progresses, though, is a complex tangle of character relationships and plot twists in both the present and past. But the story is complex in the sense that it's fun to try to do the detective work yourself and make the connections before Zafon makes them clear. It's not complex in the sense that it's at all difficult to understand what's happening. As you learn more about the twists that explain how the characters are connected (and there are some shocking ones!), the novel becomes more and more difficult to put down.Frankly, I struggled through the first couple hundred pages for the reasons mentioned above, as well as the fact that, at first, the prose is a bit clunky and it does take some getting used to. And there are several strange translation decisions (or maybe just funny typos -- ""the dice [sic] had been cast"", for example) and some anachronistic prose (""Young man, you're a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you?"" -- in 1950s Barcelona?). But by about the midpoint of the novel, the translation hits its stride, and the reader is treated to some wonderfully atmospheric and beautiful writing. In fact, for a novel in translation, for the most part, the narration and story-telling is surprisingly smooth and easy-to-read.So even though this novel violates one of my all-time literary pet peeves -- telling story through flashback -- (and yeah, like Zafon cares about MY pet peeves!) I will still begrudgingly admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it, because I understand now why Zafon made the choices he did.(One piece of advice if you decide to pick up this novel: Don't read the cover and inside blurbs. They do the novel itself a vast disservice.)",['Carlos Ruiz Zafon'],['Fiction']

Riggio,1/1,5.0,1273190400,A most entertaining read!,"""The Shadow of the Wind"" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;nReview by Anthony T. RiggioI am sometimes accused of reading too much and perhaps I do, but I came across this book upon a recommendation from a friend, who also reads abundantly. I ordered it from Amazon and when it arrived I put it down to finish two books ahead of it on my reading list.When I started to read it, I was immediately captured by the exquisite writing style of Zaf&oacute;n in his Gothic tale of The Shadow of the Wind. Even though the book was originally written in Spanish, the translation by Lucia Graves was outstanding and was easily read by an American who only speaks English.Mr. Zaf&oacute;n writes in a style that has been absent for so long in many of the books published today. The book captures you and draws you in to its complex tale which transcends two generation in Civil War Spain and its aftermath.It is a story of love and identity projections with a memorable cast of character which support this terrific story. Interestingly, it is about books and their devotees. It is a mature story of love, both romantic and familial, with some violence within relationships and a sinister anti-hero who is extremely violent. Stephen King described it as ""one gorgeous read"" and I could not use a better adjective. Read this book! You will not have regrets.",['Carlos Ruiz Zafon'],['Fiction']

The story gets increasingly complicated, revealing various passions expressed as both love and hatred, all this coinciding with a young man's passage into adulthood.The writing style is captivating. What makes even better is the fact that the main character is a good, likable guy in his teens. Everyone relates to those tumultuous years, the passion and despair of the first love, etc. Add a mystery to the mix and you have a good combination.HOWEVER... it all becomes very predictable after a while. You may not guess the exact story but you know very well where it's going. Also, I thought some characters are not well defined. This ""bad cop"" who is full of hatred and evil (for apparently little reason) is obsessed with some other guy's relationship and wants to destroy everything and everyone somewhat related to it. Another bad cop turns out to be a good guy after all. Another male character is once in love with a girl, and his [male] best friend seems to have only one purpose in life: to help them with their secret love affair, as if nothing else really mattered at all.

I almost vomitted at having to read a well rated, modern, new-ish author. Especially a translated book at that. Having read the disaster than was ""The Alchemist"" (also translated from Spanish) I was a little worried that this book might fall to the same fate of being a bit of kindly to add to the fire on a cold winter's evening. Amazingly that was not the case at all. From the moment I began reading, the language and story-telling expertise that Zafon (and the translator) have managed to put down on paper is intriguing, compelling and irresistible. You will feel as though you are running around Barcelona exploring a Gaudi inspired labyrinth of alcoves and cobbled backstreets. Unfortunately for me, the main character becomes less interesting as they struggle to evolve throughout the story despite aging considerably, however luckily another character is introduced that is much more interesting and gets you over the line.

Owen,1/1,4.0,1292025600,A good mystery with just the right mix of light and dark,"The Shadow of the Wind begins in 1945 when ten-year old Daniel is taken by his book dealer father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a place where precious books are kept hidden and protected by a chosen few. When one is initiated into the circle, they take a book and promise to protect it forever. The book Daniel chooses is called The Shadow of the Wind, written by a little-known novelist Julian Carax. Daniel begins reading the book that night and is spellbound. But when he tries to learn more about the author, he's led on a decade-long adventure through the streets of Barcelona that is full of deception, vengeance, and doomed love.It takes awhile for the story to get revved up (about 150 pages), but once it does, it moves like any good mystery, only occasionally slowing down for its many flashbacks. But this is necessary as Zafon has to take us and Daniel back to learn Carax's story. Zafon weaves an intricate web of vivid and unusual characters to surround Carax, as well as Daniel. In fact, we soon realize their stories parallel each other in many ways, especially when it comes to love and the lengths each will go for it.Set in the decade or so just after the Civil War, it is a dark and sometimes violent book. It's a Gothic novel, lots of shadows and cigarette smoke. The setting, Barcelona, is lovingly evoked; real and specific places fill the narrative and almost act as another character.This is a good mystery that is sometimes moving, sometimes exciting, and sometimes creepy. It's filled with lots of wonderfully drawn scenes that will tweak your emotions. It's a good read.",['Carlos Ruiz Zafon'],['Fiction']

There's a scandalously complex plot with characters that intersect with one another and a few plot twists thrown in for good measure. I went into this novel with high expectations, everyone seemed to proclaim it's greatness. I wanted to start the series so that I could read its lauded third installment that just released without being lost: The Prisoner of Heaven. However, despite being entranced in the delightfully complex mystery and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, I can't bring myself to wholeheartedly recommend it. Partly because its pacing is too slow for my liking in the first third, some characters falling flat, and the denouement disappointing.I'd Never Guess it was a Translation:I am usually hesitant to read translations, fearing that a beautiful literary masterpiece will be skinned bare of its artistic elements into a stoic, mundane read. I'm glad The Shadow of the Wind didn't join that party. I'm not sure how much was lost in translation--unfortunately, my Spanish comprehension ends at &iquest;C&oacute;mo est&aacute;s? and I still haven't figured out how to roll my r's--but I could've been easily fooled that this was the original. Props to Lucia Graves!Story, Bring Me Back To The Cemetery Already!:From the start of the novel, we are introduced to the mysterious Cemetery of Forgotten Books. It's any book lovers paradise, a maze comprised of old books, giving us hope that unknown masterpieces can transcend the test of time and culture. The Cemetery and the mysterious Carax novel were the most beautiful, enchanting elements of the novel, yet almost as soon as it was introduced, I had to leave it to deal with 13-year old Daniel and his infatuation with a blind girl a decade older than he. I found myself wishing Julian Carax's books really existed so I could read his masterpieces for myself. I suppose even if his novels did exist, they wouldn't be found on Amazon.Characters:I loved each character, even the minor characters aided the story in unexpected ways. I found each character special and I proudly say that there were no instances of me struggling to remember who was who.Daniel, The Protagonist:I really wanted to like Daniel, but it just didn't happen. He is good-hearted, but I found him too impulsive. I winced when I read through his first love with a blind girl ten years his senior. I knew it was a nightmare waiting to happen. For a protagonist, Daniel faded in the background. I found everyone else much more compelling than Daniel. Even if the novel was in his perspective, I still don't know anything about him other than he makes horrible romantic choices.Fermin:The idea of being best friends with someone decades older strikes me as odd, but whatever, Fermin is just that perfect friend. My favorite character.Fulmero, The Villain:I expected more back story from him. It seems like he was just evil because he had severe mental problems or something. Oh yes, and his unrequited love problem which made him bitter at everyone else. A guy that killed his own mother (even if she was a selfish, shallow woman)? Now that's spine-chillingly scary.Romance:""That was random."" pretty much sums up my reaction towards Daniel's romance. I still don't know what Daniel sees in girls beyond a pretty face. Everyone else had a better love story than the protagonist.Gothic Elements:The haunted house gave me the chills. I wanted to yank Daniel out of that house. Pretty horrible place for a date if you ask me. There were also these eerie, divine dreams that some of the characters had. Oh yes, and of course, the Devil also plays a role.Denouement, Is This Lady a Stalker?:I am disappointed that the mystery boiled down to a hundred page info-dump letter to wrap up all the loose ends instead of having Daniel solve something. I don't know how this lady knew all this stuff in such great detail to recall all the dialogue with such precision despite not even being present in most of the events. I wonder if her version of the events are trustworthy for much of was secondhand information (or should be, maybe she is a skilled stalker.) I thought she wrote the letter in a hurry in anticipation of her impending death, but if she could write a letter that spanned a third of the novel I doubt she was in a big hurry. If she had such amazing foresight, I hope she kept cyanide by her side to make her death as painless as possible.I enjoyed the complex plot and finding out how all the loose ends joined together, it's the delivery that disappointed. We ran around for two thirds of the novel gathering clues only to find out we could have just lounged on a sofa and waited for this letter to solve everything.Plot Twists:I wasn't surprised (I probably typed this review just so I can boast my psychic abilities.) Maybe I watch too many Korean dramas to prepare me for these ""scandalous"" plot twists.I wonder what the next installment will be about. I am hesitant to read it since I thought the ending tied up the story so well that I wouldn't want a lackluster sequel to ruin it. It's one of those books that I liked, but still feel the story would suffice as a standalone.",['Carlos Ruiz Zafon'],['Fiction']

Bridget Jones, in a hectic year, experiences many of the things that real women face- work problems, men problems, friend problems, problems at home. But somehow Fielding manages to make all of it funny and not as important as you would at first think. Bridget is one of the wittiest, funniest characters I've run into in a long time. She even inspired me to keep my own diary (although my life is not quite as interesting as Bridget's). This novel is guaranteed to be a classic for years to come; I read Bridget Jones' Diary in a college course on women writers recently, and the whole class loved it.This book is, of course, a takeoff of the Jane Austen classic, Pride and Prejudice. However, by bringing her characters to a modern setting, Fielding somehow manages not to loose the original air that P&amp;P possessed. The are the obvious Elizabeth and Darcy/Bridget and Darcy comparisons; the mother in Bridget Jones is a combination between Mrs. Bennet and Lydia (even down to running way with unsavory characters); and Daniel Cleaver is Mr. Wickham. Helen Fielding does not write at all like Jane Austen; but the ambience is roughly the same. Its a good idea to read both works at about the same time, so you can understand more clearly what I'm talking about.Warning, however: the movie is nothing like the book whatsoever.

Bridget Jones Diary is the story of a single British woman in her thirties, written in an easy laid back journal style. It's not the most difficult book to read, so it is a perfect book for when you just want to relax. Plus, it is written from her point of view, so you always know exactly what she is thinking. Anyone who thought that insecurities are at their peak in Junior High was proved wrong by this book making it relatable not just for the adults but also the younger readers. Jones is a business woman who is taking part in a relationship with a man in her office. However, he seems to be in control. Throughout their workday they send each other misleading instant messages, and hearing Bridget's reaction is quite amusing. Along with this office relationship, Bridget is also dealing with the pressure from her mother to get married, while at the same time she is witnessing her friends gettting divorced. If that is not enough, she is also obsessed with her weight; to the point where she weighs herself everyday. I cannot help but wonder if this is what life is actually going to be like.One of the most interesting aspects of the book is the relationship she has with a fellow co-worker. She is constantly unsure about whether or not he likes her. One night they would have a date and the next day she would be unsure about the status of their relationship, giving the book a light hearted soap opera like feel, just with less drama.Although Bridget's daily calorie and weight counts begin to get annoying, they simply add to her obsession. Her character does get a bit annoying at times because of her obsession with meaningless things, but the reader grows so attached to her character that you still feel for her when she is in these painful situations. You cannot help but to relate to Jones' character in one aspect or another; her concern about her weight, her addiction to lottery tickets, or her paranoia of relationships. Every situation she encounters seems to end up in some type of comic ending. Her insecurities and obsessions tie together perfectly to make it a book worth reading.",['Helen Fielding'],['Fiction']

I thought it was really fun to read about the insanity of war and what a person thinks of war. In my opinion war is crazy I would not want to be in a war for anything in the whole world. I could not imagine myself flying in an aircraft over a battle zone bombing things, and risking my life for my country many times. That is what the main character of the book did he was Yossarian. Yossarian was my favorite character in the book, because he understood how crazy the war was and he really didn't want to be in it. Many times he tried to get away from where he was stationed but the commanding officers would not let him leave. Yossarian made a lot of decisions throughout the book whether or not to leave the army or to stay, and he was always looking out for the most important person in his life and that was him. That related most to me, because I think of myself as the most important person in my life, and I would do whatever it took to make me happy. Not to say I wouldn't help other people, but I would look out for myself first and for most. I thought the book was very funny. The author Joseph Heller used very funny language throughout the book. His diction is what made the book so great. He made the readers see how insane war really is, which I think is really good for young people to figure out, before they get involved with the army or navy. Think how crazy you have to be to fly a jet over a place that is being bombed and try to dodge missles being fired at you. To me that would be insane and to Joseph Heller that would be insane also. I couldn't imagine myself ever wanting to go to war. People might say well your dying for your country and you have to do this to protect us, well there are other ways of solving disagreements with other countries. Every character in the book was very realistic. I thought that the soldiers were all very scared to die, and they wanted out. I wouldn't' blame them. Overall this book was really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that has the insanity of war in it, without the violence and the graphic descriptions. Some parts were confusing to me but for the most part I understood the whole book. I would read a Joseph Heller book again.",['Joseph Heller'],

I gave up early on and came back to it after reading one good review after another. The first few hundred pages can be confusing and even dull. Heller's disjointed out-of order story telling technique is very hard to come to grips with. There are some entertaining passages even at the beginning but you have to slog through many dimwitted puns. There are some scenes that are quite funny. The best, in my mind, is a scene near the end, where Yossarian is offered the chance to go home by the Colonels that have been tormenting him. There's only one catch, he has to agree to like them, to be their pal, and say good things about them. This is unacceptable and he chooses instead to run away. Skip the puerile chapter titled ""Major Major Major Major."" The one joke of this insult to the reader's intelligence is the character's name: Major Major Major and the rank he is automatically promoted to on joining the army.It gets better after the slow start and story begins to come together once you get halfway through. Yossarian, or Yo-Yo to his friends, is the unhappy and psychotic bombardier who is the central character of this non-story. He's afraid of dying and is upset that his superiors have repeatedly raised the number of combat missions he must fly before he can go home. His friends are killed while incompetent, evil people are promoted and prosper. The black-marketeers Ex-PFC Wintergreen and especially Milo Minderbinder get rich. He's haunted by the memory of a fellow flyer (Snowden) dying in his arms over Avignon.Whether you think this novel is a good or not, it exists and many people who have never read the book are familiar with the title phrase. Heller uses Yossarian's situation to makes some points about the absurdity of war and, perhaps, of modern life in a Capitalist society. He points out that you are ""free"" just as long as you never actually want to use any of your freedom. It's interesting to see a depiction of American soldiers during WWII who have absolutely no patriotic or heroic feelings but are only concerned with saving their skin or perhaps profiting from the situation they are in. Mailer, in The Naked and the Dead, and other authors have expressed these sentiments better. This take on war and American society came to be the norm in the aftermath of the Vietnam War but it probably seemed very subversive when this book came out in 1961.",['Joseph Heller'],
0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A2P8XBM08EV8FE,Carl W. Banks,7/11,2.0,1046822400,I'm not the right type to enjoy this novel,"You have to be a certain type of person to like this novel. I imagine many people are that type of person. I am not.For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them. Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal. Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.Take General Peckem. It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone. Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all. In fact, I found him rather efficient.Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them. But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters. Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity. It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much. Also, there was a ridiculous overuse of a certain figure of speech (mostly used to describe Milo).On the good side, the book was quite funny, and the satire was amusing where it made sense to me.",['Joseph Heller'],

It reflects the crazy, upside down world where insane is sane, incompetence rules, and one (or, as it turns out, two) person stands alone and upholds his sanity.A few highlights:the chapter on milo's syndicate is an economic masterpiece. Not only is it hysterical but it is a perfect example of a modern market economy based on absolutely nothing.chaplain trappman's interrogation at the hands of the CID is another example of english writing at its best. Remember, the CID man has had latin training so he knows the chaplain is ""not a baptist.""I find myself quoting this book constantly.

0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A3OCXR007QS2XU,Ella,1/1,5.0,1113350400,Surreal & Superb,"'Catch-22' is an excellent novel, a true masterpiece of the 20th century. Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy.Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all.Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way.For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel.One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar.It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.Timeless & flawless - you must read this book",['Joseph Heller'],

Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society. But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant. Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material.The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II. It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar. He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead. The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military. When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission. But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly. To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital. It is here that he is first introduced to ""Catch-22.""Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends. So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly. Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity. He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.) But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation.The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times. The character of the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel. None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from. The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America. Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous. Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country.Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war. It does well to hold the reader's attention. The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read. It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be. Pick it up; if you don't like the first two pages, then don't bother reading it, but if you do, you'll enjoy the rest of the book.",['Joseph Heller'],

0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A21HDRSF48W174,Har Pikada,10/18,2.0,1186444800,Catch-11,"Just finished reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22.I did not like it. Here are my reasons. I have avoided citation of specific instances in support of a point so as not to give anything away.Heller works the novel like an Archilochus/Isaiah Berlin hedgehog - around the idea of people entrapped, enervated and then destroyed by intended and unintended contradictions of, in this case, the war machinery. Perhaps the indictment is of any powerful bureaucracy - even life itself. The irrational and dehumanizing aspects of war unfold in farcical iterations. Each iteration further fleshes out and reinforces the chimerical webs that entrap the flies - the harder they struggle against it.The author is most formidable in his use of the language. What skill it must take to overuse the language so incredibly, yet, so lightly. His pen shows no strain - none at all - as it moves left to right, up and down - over and over again - fluting out in steady drips a full mountain of descriptors. It would be achievement enough if the overlapping descriptors somehow came together harmlessly. But here the imagery is all the more better for it. As if, using the elements/techniques of oil painting, one has churned out a most exquisite set of watercolors! Gestures, expressions, movement of any kind rise from the medium of words to that of a resplendent image almost immediately. This, I propose, is Heller's true achievement.No doubt, Heller has several sources and inspirations. Certainly one of them is Dostoevsky, class Hedgehog. But Heller's one big idea is hardly novel. Literature has many memorably executed suffocating, paradoxical, tragicomic bureaucracies. Repetition of an idea is in itself not a critical drawback because new ideas are not so easy to come by. An existing idea newly represented such as to expand its scope and understanding can be just as worthy an achievement. But there too Heller falls short.Heller fails because his deliberate, repeating exaggerations become too repetitious. The iterative unfolding of the novel is thick with dialogs, events, characterizations that repeat far more than they move. After a point these repetitions do not add anything significant to any aspect of the novel. The plot is not any more intricate for it. The characters are not any more intelligent or coherent or paranoid for it. The repetitions cease to reinforce anything. In-fact they blunt any worthwhile movement that comes along. Such as ascension of Milo's enterprise into lunacy. The repetitions strip all the edge of such progressions.Since Heller himself makes several references to Crime and Punishment let us consider it. Too serious and intricate a comparison would be silly but one may still compare certain general aesthetics like plot and character richness. Look at the exquisite contemplative gallop with which Raskalnikov moves to crime and then towards punishment. Look at the coherence of his paranoia. Look at the rich characterizations of Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovitch.But yes, having said that, I think, Yossarian's stroll through war torn Rome is just as beautifully illustrated as any of Raskalnikov's stroll through Petersburg.All in all, I think the novel is worth reading for its language. Otherwise, I would put it after so many of those other outstanding classics.",['Joseph Heller'],
0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A3DXV5YMDJE6EW,Tyler M.,3/5,2.0,1262131200,A disappointing book.,"I just finished reading this book, and it was definitely a chore. I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the ""Jokes"" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching ""Lost"" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities, but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book.",['Joseph Heller'],

So, if you're a bit skiddish of vulgar language and references you'll be sorely disapointed in this book.The whole book is full of catch-22s.

Stallcup,3/5,3.0,1292889600,Perhaps It Hasn't Aged Well,"I don't presume to add much to the varied and detailed reviews of the book, except perhaps for an observation on how a popular work esteemed by one generation simply may not transcend its own time.Like many, I first read Catch-22 many years ago in high school. I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the ""counter-culture"" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism. War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as ""absurd,"" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the ""syndicate"" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin. Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary. Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step. More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before. Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and 70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation. Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc. It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it). I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking. And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many ""popular"" or ""political"" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was. On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site. That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire.",['Joseph Heller'],
0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A3KTN5FAMUV36H,Flying Photographer,0/1,3.0,1335312000,A Catch for the beginner - why to read (or not) this novel,"While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the ""catch-22"" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.Now to the real meat, the content.If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be ""catched""!",['Joseph Heller'],
0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A2IKY4WH4E11AI,Avid Reader,1/1,5.0,1345852800,Awe-inspiring,"Nobody needs me to say that ""Catch 22"" is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It's incredibly powerful today, and it's hard to imagine the impact it must have had when it was published more than 50 years ago.The book strips away any pretense about the glory, intelligence, or fairness of war. It shows the cynical, base motives of the most human of actions: violence. It highlights the absurdities --- the utter contradictions --- that each of us face every day in our lives.The thing that struck me most about ""Catch 22"" on what's probably my fourth reading is that it's so densely packed. There are entire paragraphs that you need to read again and again because they have a remarkable perspective about the human condition. But then you struggle to remember them 10 pages later because of the new ideas that Heller has raised. One technique that Heller has mastered to create this density (for all I know, he invented it) is absurdist statements: ""The Texas turned out to be good natured, generous and likeable. In three days, no one could stand him."" There are hundreds of these passages in the book.Heller also uses rare adjectives and adverbs throughout the text, often paired with a more familiar word. Again this adds to the density of the reading, even as you turn to an online dictionary for a definition.The book is also memorably grueseome and sexual, sometimes together. The bomber pilots lead a warped life, and so even their leisure is warped. They're whoring and cheating as much as possible, usually out in the open because they simply don't live in a just society any more. As an old, starving Italian woman explains to Yossarian near the end of the book, when he asks her why Military Police destroyed her whorehouse: ""Catch 22 says they have a right to do anything that we can't stop them from doing.""Just when you think you're going to like someone or that the book is going to be fun, Heller slams you with a wounded or dead pilot or a child prostitute. It never stops.Basically, you become like Yossarian, the protagonist, in that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs that everyone and everything is crazy, and that we need a new crop of adults to come in and change the situation. Yet, because it's war and human nature, it will never happen.",['Joseph Heller'],
0394603753,Catch-Twenty-Two,,A2I6RN76IIIV34,Mark R,1/1,5.0,1348790400,Comedy in War,"Creating comedy during the murderous insanity of World War 2 is nothing short of pure genius. Joseph Heller, author of the fictional masterpiece Catch-22 showed the world a different view of the perils encountered during war, twisting them into a witty page turner. The story's main character, United States Air Force Captain John Yossarian, is a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea in the year 1943. Understandably, Yossarian continuously tries to scheme his way out of flying bombing missions, since thousands of people he has not met are trying to kill him. Despite his best efforts, Colonel Cathcart continues to increase the amount of missions the men must fly to satisfy their service requirements and return home. As the title suggests, there is a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause in Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. ""That's some catch, that Catch-22"" he observed. (p.46)The above quote is one basic yet confusing catch can be put into simpler terms: a person is considered insane if he willingly flies combat missions, but if he requests to be removed from flying, he is deemed sane and therefore fit to fly. This basic element continually puts Yossarian in danger by the very system he is supposed to be protecting. He is more concerned with his own survival instead of winning the war, calling into question his integrity and patriotism.Heller follows no traditional structure in his novel, rather relies on free association to tie the book together. While the storyline seems at times to follow no discernible path, it perfectly echoes war is itself. Both are vain, chaotic and irrational. But it is that very structure (or lack thereof) that sets the book apart from anything else ever written. Having this book follow any sort of chronological order normally found in other novels would do Catch-22 (1961) a disservice and detract from its overall greatness. Heller implants key flashbacks and side stories at critical points during Yossarian's journey to save his own hide. The complicated storyline structure requires the reader's careful attention to accurately understand all descriptions and anecdotes. Heller introduces complex characters and themes early on, but waits until further in the text requiring the reader to rely on both recollection and foreshadowing.The book also uses third person omniscient narration to further develop and complicate the storyline. The reader learns more from each character than they would if the book was only through Yossarian's eyes. These different points of view allow the reader to fully grasp inside jokes and see characters in a complete three dimensional light. Few characters, due to the in depth detail in which they are described, are considered minor character.Catch-22 (1961) is a classic masterpiece that has withstood the test of time by being in a category all on its own. Pulling out all the stops, it grasps the reader and leaves you yearning for more. The book's influence on American culture culminated on the phrase ""catch 22"" becoming popular in the English language for a situation with idiotic circular logic further testifying to Heller's brilliance.",['Joseph Heller'],

It is a strike at the idiocy of bureaucracy gone mad;it is a telling commentary on the frailty of man trying to live by the standards of decency and humanity he was brought up with, under the madness of war.Catch 22 is also an outstanding piece of entertainment. The first hundred pages or so have been described by minds greater than mine as '... Hysterical farce...' and more than once I had to put the book aside in order to wipe the tears (of laughter) from the corners of my eyes. Chapter three - subtitled &#34;HAVERMEYER&#34; is the first highlight of the book and I was in stitches several times as I read, and tried to read, and make sense of the glorious text found within. The writing style is unique. The book itself is easy to read. It has a straightforward plot (was there a plot?) which kept the pages turning but it did not take long for Heller to remind you are reading a book about war, and that war is dangerous, and people whom we love, people whom we are destined to love but never will, are bound to die fighting for the causes that we all hold dear. And some chapters you can hold up high for the joy and merriment they bring, the next chapter is just as likely to bring you back down to earth with a jolt, as one of Yo-Yo's friends go missing, and are presumed dead, or meets a particularly gruesome death in a way that no one could have predicted. But as each one dies, there is no way that it can be said that they died without every single shred of their character still intact.Catch 22 is hysterically funny, and at times, incredibly sad. It is a tribute to the strength and power of the human spirit, and as such is worthy of the five stars that I hereby give it. It is a classic novel, a book for the ages. Catch 22 is timeless. I think I need to read it again. Now.Greggles (LR)",['Joseph Heller'],

It makes the reader think, it makes the reader laugh, and when it is all said and done Catch-22 gives the reader a great World War II novel that is told through some of the most unlikely soldiers.One of the main attractions to the novel is its comical tone. Comedy is found all throughout the book ranging from Yossarian's unorthodox ways of getting himself out combat duty to Nately's struggles to make a prostitute love him. Also the story is told in a unique circular way which constantly parallels the overall theme of explaining the purpose of what ""Catch-22"" means.If there is a fault in the book it is the slow development of the story. The chapters only give the reader a small taste of what the overall story is about and the storyline doesn't start forming until about halfway through the book. While this might deter some readers it can also create an incentive for the others to continue on and finish the story. Heller in a way makes his novel a puzzle that doesn't become completed until the very last chapter. The chapters in his novel could probably be read in any order (with the exception of the last chapter) and still make as much sense as if it was read the way it is printed.Catch-22 is a truly unique novel that will appeal to any reader as well as those interested in World War II literature. While the slow and confusing development of the story is its only glaring let down is also has an appeal that almost forces the reader to continue on with the novel so that all the confusion and loose ends can be cleared away by the time the last chapter is finished. The comical scenes as well as the ingenious elaboration behind the meaning of ""Catch-22"" and how it applies throughout the novel will entertain readers for years and years. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 will remain on book shelves for years to come and is a literary work of art that shall never be overlooked.",['Joseph Heller'],

By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms.

Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings.

A lady named Mrs. Fairfax comes to take her to where she works so Jane can live with them. Jane is a governess who teaches a little girl named Adele. When the master of the house, Mr. Rochester, comes and Jane starts to like him.

Jane heads back to Thornfield and falls in love and almost marries. But then she finds her self-alone and penniless, then Jane finds that she is rich.

This book is interesting because it was very expressive of how a teenage life is through this book. The reason why it is so expressive is that the book drags out a teenager life of how problems come and go around.

One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term ""Plain Jane,"" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the ""mad"" Antoinette ""Bertha"" Mason.",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Charity-schools']

However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world.

Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were ""wow - what a wonderful journey."" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote ""St John is a failure I think but a good failure."" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is ""fact is stranger than fiction."" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated ""such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.""

Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes. The beginning of the book had a slow start, but I believe it was necessary to set up the stage for the rest of the novel.

Both pull off the near impossible task of presenting the reader (or viewer) with horrible nasty people and then at the last moment making us see them as simply angry human beings fully capable of redemption and understanding, even if its too late to do anything with their lives.The book starts out with one of foppiest of English fops touring the Manor with a utter contempt for these people and their ways. The stories that he hears from the servants only confirm his view, but they are intriguing. No one tells what they want to tell and there are times when you want to strangle the servants telling the stories (especially the one that PURPOSELY hid a note that would have eased some of the tensions because she didn't feel that it would be right. How many interfering old bitties like this are in the world? Probably more in the Victorian era.)The love between Heathcliff and Catherine might have worked out in different circumstances, if Heathcliff had not been the hated adopted gypsy child, if Catherine's brother hadn't been an idiot drunk, if Catherine hadn't been pledged to marry the idiot next door. Of course, then it wouldn't have been such an intriguing novel. Heathcliff comes back the conquering hero to find that Catherine is married and her idiot brother is still a drunk and he can't have her so he plays dangerous games with people's hearts and gears everything to his twisted revenge. Included in his schemes are the marrying of Catherine's sister-in-law and the corrupting of Catherine's nephew (the son of the drunken idiot).It's pretty rough going and you want to like Heathcliff at least more than the rest of the people in this book, but he gives you no room to excuse his actions. He's just horrible. Then like Kevin Spacey at the end of American Beauty, he reveals himself and comes to a point of self-reflection and repentence that fulfils the hope you had for him at the beginning of the book.

The reader finds him/herself loathing each and every one of them. The only non-loathsome character is the doctor, and he's minor to the extreme. Heathcliff is of course abominable. Edgar Linton is appallingly stupid. Hareton Earnshaw is animalistic, but at least he's got the excuse of Heathcliff's abuse. Catherine Linton (the elder) is absolutely disgusting, easily and by far the most evil character in the novel, surpassing even Heathcliff. Even Nelly Dean is a waste of humanity. If it were not for her constantly making a hash of her meddling, none of the tragedy would have occurred to such a great extent. Whether her meddling is malicious or just through sheer stupidity is immaterial; she remains an awful character.That said, the story is absolutely riveting. Emily Bronte's one substantive work is truly a masterpiece. Her descriptions of the moors are wonderfully evocative, but it is her characters who are her main triumph. Despite the sheer horridness or stupidity or weakness of her characters, she nevertheless makes each of them - and their motivations - utterly believable. Even Heathcliff's excesses are believable, and the elder Catherine's petty maliciousness is also totally in tune with the selfish nature she is depicted as having. The younger Catherine Linton's stupidity is easily accounted for by her protected childhood and Nelly's inexcusable lapses. Everyone has a perfectly plausible reason for doing what they do, given the natures given them by Bronte. Is it then their fault that their actions create such misery?The only flaw with this book is the ending. One character has triumped utterly, and then inexplicably collapses with hardly a struggle. Another character overcomes a strong antipathy to a further character and changes attitudes utterly. Unlike the rest of the novel, the motivation is not believable. It is inconceivable that such a complete adjustment could have happened in so short a time. Perhaps it is true that the novel has come full circle, but I can't help but think that its grip on the reader would be still the stronger if it left us with the vision of the horror which appeared to be the future for its well-deserving characters.",['Emily Brontë'],['Foundlings']

You should listen to it--I must warn you that you may dislike it.I read the novel, Wuthering Heights, years ago in middle school and have forgotten most of the story. The song piqued my interest in the novel, and I began reading it yesterday. It has been described as, perhaps, one of the most original novels in the English language. Its wild and untamed story, written on the windswept canvas of the moors of northern England, is written in an excited and lyrical manner.

Although I think fans of the series should read this book if they're interested, I would *seriously* recommend borrowing it or waiting for the paperback. What I've loved about Harris's previous work is that he's an extremely intelligent, always surprising writer; I had no expectations for this novel as far as plot goes, but silly me, I *was* expecting it to be competently written.Instead, I got ridiculous character inconsistency, and I'm not even talking about the idiotic ending, which I can only assume had to be a joke. (To a much lesser degree, I had the same problem with the screenplay for &quot;Silence&quot;: They changed details about the characters that made certain lines nonsensical, but left those lines in.) While everyone discusses in tones of awe how Lecter's genius at hiding himself will make him near impossible to catch, the genius himself is busy being instantly found by everyone, everywhere he goes, by doing every single thing people think he will do.I got pathetic Psych 101 rationales: Lecter is evil because of his traumatic childhood (awww...); Starling figures all black people (her best friend included) will hate her because, in the line of duty, she shot a homicidal drug dealer who shot her first (because as we all know, every African-American alive holds homicidal drug dealers in near-holy reverence).When my friend lent me this book, he said, &quot;Don't get too excited.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh, it couldn't be that bad!&quot; I chuckle bitterly now, looking back at my innocence.

It is NOT a movie, these are NOT your characters, Mr. Harris created them and can do whatever he likes. He didn't force you to wait around for 11 years. To me, Hannibal is wonderfully written (but in need of some skillful editing) and gripping from beginning to end. Ah yes, the ending: love it or hate it, it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the page. In concocting the closing scenes of Hannibal, Mr. Harris has written some of the most vivid and indelible lines in recent American fiction. The complaining and criticizing of this book amazes and amuses me. Stephen King -- who knows just a little bit more about writing than the rest of us -- gave Hannibal a rave review. That review aptly describes most of what is great about this book but does gloss over the weaknesses such as the uneven writing and the drawn-out Italy scenes. Ignore the grammatically incorrect, misspelling-laden, complaining reviews you see below (including the one from the &quot;Mensa&quot; member -- impressive!).

0440224675,Hannibal,7.67,,,3/3,2.0,932256000,"Pas gourmet, mais gourmand...","With ample anticipation, I purchased Thomas Harris' novel with the impression that my grasp of Hannibal Lecter and other characters would become more lucid through the author's usual penetrating eye and style. However, as I turned from page to page, it became evident that something was awry. The clever repartee that I awaited was not extant. The characters, although fully fleshed, remain feeble and superficial. Mason Verger, the novel's antagonist (and I use this term loosely) is more annoying than sinister, and his henchmen loiter around the perimeter of the work, never seeming to join in (which is perhaps wise on their part). Both Mason and his sister Margot are not much more than &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;-esque individuals who canker the types of characterizations that Jame Gumb and Francis Dolorhyde made sacrosanct in the previous works. Verger's grand scheme to take vengeance on Lecter is nothing more than the puerile devises of an imbecile plotting against a genius. I found myself guffawing at his ideas. I pray that Harris intended Verger to be the fool that he is. Clarice Starling endures as a strong-willed FBI agent; however, she seems to flounder as second banana. Finally, there is Dr. Hannibal Lecter: psychiatrist, connoisseur, and cannibal. When I undertook the challenge of reading the novel, it was the insights into Lecter's personality and peculiar history that I eagerly awaited. What I discovered was a frightened little boy grown up, exercising frightening abilities all for the sake of finding his lost little sister. Pardon me, but big woo! As far as plot, it falls back on itself, unable to stand confidently in the face of extreme absurdities such as Verger's breeding of vicious man-eating swine and Paul Krendler's gourmet lobotomy, not to mention the &quot;possession&quot; of Clarice Starling at the end of the work. To put it simply, it became increasingly difficult to suspend willingly my disbelief as I progressed through the murky echoes of flashbacks and inane disclosures. Winding around the corners, it became apparent that I was lost within a labyrinth of my own creation. That is to say, I was bound to Harris' previous novels by invisible and velvet chains, while this essay seemed to imprison me within the confines of some medieval torture device. Although I could not put the novel down-mainly in hopes that it would improve and come to its senses-something about the rhythm of the text seduces the reader, hypnotizes him, deludes him into believing that arcane mysteries will be unveiled. I for one found myself muttering and grumbling at the fact that something was simply not right and that it never was going to be. In any event, I must commend Harris on his detailed research. Every particular is polished-each fragment brilliant. His work is reminiscent of Eco or Borges in its permeating gaze and de Sade in its brutality. However, even these perquisites are not enough to liberate Hannibal from the ominous death knell that critics will ring. Hannibal will be remembered (and most likely forgotten) as the novel whose reach extended beyond its grasp. Nonetheless, Hannibal, taken on its own is a striking, if often graphic expos&eacute; of the deviant and preternatural. It is the answer to the rhetorical question that readers often ask at the end of a novel: what happens next? Unfortunately, this question is one that no one really wants answered; it ultimately dispels the illusion the reader has carefully crafted in his mind. The novel is a good example of when too much is not a good thing. Hannibal is an inferior addition to an otherwise sterling set.",['Thomas Harris'],['Fiction']

Too much detail on the peripherals, too little detail where it might have helped. Convoluted, impossible plot. An ending that can only be the product of a short-timer. Gratuitous grossness, where I was expecting the exquisite craft and subtlety of SotL and Red Dragon. The characters were, for the most part, formulaic caricatures - Harris really skimped when he was creating or elaborating on them. As for Starling and Lecter, Harris took them out of themselves and made them each into something particularly disappointing. He took a cheap out in defining why Lecter is the way he is, and removed all intrigue from the man - made him a mealy-minded sentimental idiot. And what he did to Starling dismayed me to no end. After the first few chapters, I really came to despise her in her weakness and shallowness. Harris owes much more to the characters that he so superbly brought to life in his previous two books. He owes a lot more to his loyal readers, as well, and turning out mindless, off-the-wall, unbelievable drivel like this will, at the least, decimate the legions of his loyal readers if he does not find some way to make amends.The book started out all right - but after the first couple of chapters, well - let's just say I could have had a better quality read curling up with Olivia Goldsmith or Jackie Collins or even Louis L'Amour. I was shocked and saddened by Harris' selling out as he obviously did. I regret to say that I finished the book, hoping with the turn of every page that Harris would redeem himself. He did not. If you loved SotL or Red Dragon, do yourself a favor and skip this cookie cutter refuse. If you insist upon reading it despite the ample warnings from hundreds of readers who, like me, felt cheated, at least borrow it from the library, rather than wasting money in addition to time.There are plenty of other bad things I could say about this most unsatisfying book - but at the moment (I just finished it an hour ago), I am so dumbfounded by its ineptitude and sheer badness that words fail me. That seems to be a trend - words most obviously failed Harris in the writing of this unbelievably poor excuse for a novel.In sum, &quot;YUCK!&quot; What a rip off.

I should have known better than to buy and read it especially after perusing the plotline revelations online, but when I read Silence of the Lambs curiosity got the better of me so I went into Hannibal with low expectations and it was even worse than what I had expected.First problem, the entire plotline involving Mason Verger is insipid and uninspired. I refuse to believe it took Thomas Harris 10 years to come up with it. It transcends willing suspension of disbelief and lands squarely in the c'mon-get-real-this-is-just-way-too-dumb category of fiction. It borders on insulting the reader's intelligence.Second, the conclusion involving Clarice and Hannibal is jaw-dropping only in the sense that it too is completely unbelievable and contrary to everything that Clarice said, did and stood for in Silence of the Lambs.Third, the supposedly chilling scenes were comical rather than scary. While Lambs was full of scenes containing genuine suspense and horror, Hannibal lacks all of that. Some examples include the dinner scene with Krendler, the final scene with Mason and his sister, and anything involving the Sardinians.Hannibal fails in too many ways to enumerate here.

It opens on a positive note with a shootout practically written for the screen, and stays rather steady from there with the pleasant exception of a few surprisingly gory parts (even for Harris) which are excellently told with a deadpan demeanor. A few of the descriptions of Florence are so unnecessarily extensive that they make one think that Harris is simply showing off how much he knows about the city. The novel picks up after it leaves Florence and hurries toward a repulsively good climax. As others have said, the ending of the book is ridiculous, poorly thought out, and hugely disappointing.

0440224675,Hannibal,7.67,,,3/3,3.0,960508800,Adagio - a transitional piece,"Writers of &quot;thinking people's horror&quot; novels face an interesting challenge. Once a franchise viably captures the public's imagination, readers demand sophisticated, exciting innovations on a familiar theme. However, as the bar gets raised higher and higher, and as readers become de-sensitized, most series inevitably go stale or become far-fetched. Think, for example, of the sagging work of Canadian author Michael Slade, who like Thomas Harris, writes about brilliant serial killers with a flair for ingenious, over-the-top gorefests, replete with historical context and arcane erudition. The difference is, Thomas Harris takes a very long time between installments; and therefore, Harris fans are justified in believing they deserve better.The Hannibal Lecter series reached this &quot;what next&quot; juncture in the last decade, with The Silence Of The Lambs. At the end of that novel, readers were left with the impression that the series would follow a Hannibal Lecter let loose on the world, free to travel and kill in new and creative ways, in diverse and exotic locales, while staying one step ahead of the law - a cannibalistic version of Anne Rice's globetrotting vampire superstars.In writing Hannibal, Mr. Harris was clearly cognizant of the need to keep his series unpredictable. His choice of plot does accomplish that objective -- but in ways that may leave fans feeling disappointed.Instead of a dashing Scarlet Pimpernel of cannibalism, Hannibal Lecter 3.0 is a stuffy, academic type, ensconced in a low-key arts curator job in Italy, indulging his appetite for fine arts and foods, rather than for people. Indeed, one almost suspects that Lecter's violence is justified under a reluctant vigilante ethos -- that he'd gladly not bother a soul, as long as he's left alone under protective cover, free at last to pursue his arts research. Lecter's charisma is dim here (as an offbeat analogy, compare Harrison Ford's roles today with his Han Solo character in Star Wars).This plot judo gives Mr. Harris license to turn many tables on us. First, he dials down Lecter's threat quotient to purely reactive mode, morphing Lecter into an almost sympathetic character motivated by a desire for anonymity and a need to heal the scars of his own childhood.Having put Lecter in neutral, Mr. Harris stokes the fires of dementia in a Class A nemesis, Mason Verger - an abominable child abuser and clever manipulator of political power, whom Lecter had horribly (justly?) victimized in times past. Driven insane by a need for revenge, and suitably well financed, Verger insists on bringing Lecter out of his shell; but the author executes this plot strand too laboriously, telegraphs his intentions too obviously to be particularly disturbing. Third, the author reduces the FBI to Mason Verger's tool -- a bunch of infighting, incompetent bureaucrats, venal and corrupt, concerned more with media politics than with apprehending criminals. Allegorically, the real monster in Hannibal is not Lecter, but &quot;the system&quot; -- wealthy bad guys and the goverment that colludes with them.As if all this were not enough, Mr. Harris puts Clarice Starling on an emotional intersection course with Hannibal Lecter. The results of that strange alliance will strain the credulity of even the most flexible-minded reader. Even the author's elegant prose and stylized horror scenography backfire, lending an aura of John Cleese-style formal absurdity to a final dinner episode that was supposed to horrify.All in all, at this point in the series, fans of Thomas Harris probably deserved an outrageously wild and energetic novel. Instead, the author decided to give us the literary equivalent of an Adagio. Therefore, Hannibal leaves open some questions that may be more interesting than the novel itself. Is Hannibal the beginning of the decline in the Cannibal series? Did Thomas Harris &quot;go Hollywood&quot;? Or is he transitioning into fresh, creative new territory?

It becomes essentially a series of disconnected revenge fantasies perpetrated by the wicked and powerful for the pleasure of us, the meek and powerless. Completing the condescension with multiple references to the icons of haut bourgeois consumption, a la &quot;Lives of the Rich and Famous&quot;, Harris dangles before us scenes of Lecter buying perfumed soaps in Florence, sipping Chateau Petrus (fabulously expensive red wine), Chateau d'Yquem (fabulously rare and expensive sweet white wine}, and Montrachet (the most expensive white burgundy--easily several hundred a bottle). It's only too easy to imagine Harris calling his local wine merchant and saying, &quot;Say, what are the world's three most famous and expensive wines?&quot; And surely, Lecter must realize, with his exquisite sense of smell, that the dominant perfume in all of these treats is the musk of self-congratulation.By the end of the book, ones senses Harris's fatigue and loss of control, as Starling is reduced to a gleaming wet dream surrounded by candles and flowers no interior decorator could have arranged more artfully.Akways, in the background, one hears the clanking machinery of the library research teams, generating esoterica about hog breeding, medieval Florentine architecture, various fetish automobiles--all stuff Ian Fleming did years ago, and better.

Those who haven't read much (and widely) are less likely to be able to discriminate between what is significant and what is not.

I always wanted to like The Great Gatsby because it was one of those books in the canon of accepted 'great' American books, but repeated attempts at the book still leave me cold. I don't find anyone in the novel to care for and if one doesn't care about the characters, one doesn't care what happens to them.'Gatsby', I think, is a minor book about very shallow people.

Scott Fitzgerald, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. in New York in 1925. The book is about the American Dream and the failure of the attempt to reach its illusionary goals, especially the Gatsby's. The attempt to capture the American Dream is central theme to many stories of all times. For Gatsby, the dream is that one can acquire love and happiness through wealth and power. F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896 - 1940) was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He was an American short-story writer and novelist. The Great Gatsby is considered as Fitzgerald's finest novel.The story was set in New York and Long Island in 1920's. Nick Carraway is a young man working as a bond broker in New York. He is used as the narrator throughout the story. Nick acts as an insider as well as an outsider. He eyes everything that is happening in between, but has no intention to interfere. I think he chooses not to lose anybody close to him in the story. This arrangement makes it easy for Fitzgerald to give the audience detailed inside information and to back out as an outsider as needed. The core character, Jay Gatsby, is a character that longs for the past. He devotes most of his adult life trying to recapture it and he finally pays his life as the price in his pursuit. When he was young in the military, Gatsby fell in love with the beautiful Daisy, but he could not marry her because of the difference in their social status. So he left her to acquire wealth. When he got the wealth legally or illegally, he moved near to Daisy, who has already married to another wealthy man, and threw extravagant parties every week hoping Daisy might show up one day at the party. Finally, he set up a meeting with Daisy through her cousin Nick. Fitzgerald uses Gatsby's personal dream to symbolize the larger American Dream where all have the opportunity to get what they want.Nick is a multi-functional character to the author. He uses Nick as the approach for Gatsby to Daisy. The author naturally arranges all these. Gatsby cannot accept that the past is gone and done with. Nick once attempts to show him the folly of his dream, but Gatsby innocently replies to Nick's assertion that the past cannot be relived. For Gatsby, his American Dream is not material possessions, although it may seem that way. He only comes into wealth to fulfill his Dream, Daisy.Gatsby believes that he is acting for good beyond his personal interest and that should guarantee success. However, he is terribly wrong. He is so determined and so blind that he would do anything to get Daisy, even covering her up for the fatal accident. His dream never comes about and he ends up paying the ultimate price for it. The idea of the American Dream still holds true in today's time, which is wealth, love, or fame. But one thing never changes about the American Dream. That is everyone desires something in life and strives to get it. Gatsby is a good example of pursuing the American Dream.A society naturally breaks up into various social groups over time. Members of the lower statuses constantly suppose that their problems can be solved if they gain enough wealth to reach the upper class. Fitzgerald believes in his story that many people interpret the American Dream as being this passage to high social status. They believe once reaching that point, they do not have to worry about money any more. Though, the American Dream involves more than the social and economic standings of an individual.It seems that the more Gatsby tries to obtain, the less he ends up with. The saddest part of Gatsby is the funeral, which symbolizes the ultimate failure of Gatsby to ever achieve what he has wanted. The women he loved and died for was not present. None of the people who frequented the parties over the summer showed up. Wolfsheim, whom Nick believed to be a close friend to Gatsby, refused to attend. The idealism conflicts with the materialism and is torn apart. However, it is his father who lives at the bottom of the society, who is the most natural and native person in the story, whom Gatsby has never mentioned about, finds his way to his son's mansion for the funeral. What greatness of a father's love is in contrast to the love that Gatsby died for? That is the love of eternity. The father loves his son no matter his son is rich or poor. At this moment, both the idealism and materialism are eclipsed by the truthfulness and naturalness. And that is why Nick was tired of the life there, the carelessness of the people, and the corruption of the society in the American East. He decided to head back to his origin, to the more natural and traditional American Mid-West.Gatsby possesses an extreme imbalance between the material and spiritual sides of himself. Fitzgerald uses him as a portrait of the ultimate failure of the American Dream in that individuals tend to believe wealth is everything. Maybe what Fitzgerald wants to say is that a nation cannot operate solely on materialism. The spirits of individuals are the true composition of a nation.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['American Dream']
0460872702,Great Gatsby (Everyman),,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira""",1/3,5.0,1105228800,An American tragedy,"Considered one of the best and most important books in English, Francis Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" is one of the few intellectual novels that are at the same time widely popular. The writer's vivid descriptions of the Jazz Age ranks as the best, and his language and character development can be understood by young and adult readers both.Published in 1925, this book has many events inspired by Fitzgerald wealthy life. The narrator --and one of the main characters--, Nick Carraway, like his creator, is a young man from Minnesota educated at an Ivy League School (Yale), who moves to New York after the war. At the same time, the main character, Jay Gatsby, also share many things in common with Fitzgerald. Both are young and sensitive, and, what is more interesting, is the fact that they have a very romanticized vision of wealth and love, and felt in love with a young woman when in a military camp in South.Nick starts his narrative telling that his readers an advice his father gave him, telling that when he feels like criticizing someone he should remember that he is not in a position of doing so, because he has had many advantages in his live. Beginning with that, it is sort of a disclaimer as if the writer is telling that in his narrative he is just portraying a story, rather than making judgments on the events and people. Smart movie -- since most of the novel reads like a big criticism against the lost of the American Dream, due to money and corruption.Nick is learn bond business, and lives in New York. He rents a house in the West Egg district. His neighbor seems to be wealthy and happy -- he is throwing parties in an everyday base. One day he goes to East Egg to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband. He meets young Jordan Baker, a young woman who claims to know his neighbor. He is Mr Gatsby. She also tells him that Tom has a lover.Days later, Jordan invites Nick for a meeting and tells him about Daisy and Gatsby. They used to date before the war. And now, the man wants that Nick and Jordan arrange a meeting for him and Daisy at Nick's. Once the couple meets again, the tragedy starts in the characters lives.By telling this American Tragedy -- and loss of American dream -- Nick is very contradictory. To begin with he is making judgments -- not following his father advices --alternating moments when he is very objective, and moments when he seems to give his own interpretation of the facts. What also has resonance in ""The Great Gatsby"" is the nostalgic tone adopted by the narrator. He seems to be telling about the end of a civilization that no longer exists, and at the same time he feels guilty for its destruction.On another point, Nick/Fitzgerald is criticizing the hollowness of the upper classes. This is the part when the book has a sociological --and not only literary-- interest. The West Egg citizens represent the noveau rich; while the East Egg ones are the aristocracy. The newly riches are vulgar and have no social grace or taste. Gatsby is his most effective example of that. But the aristocracy, on the other hand, lacks heart -- they don't care if hurt other people. Ironically Gatsby's best qualities (love and loyalty) are what lead him to the tragedy.""The Great Gastsby"" is a very short and entertaining book. Written with beautiful language and extremely well characters. It is a passionate and unforgettable portray of a civilization that doesn't exist any longer -- like something gone with the wind.",['F.

An interesting fact is that he was named after his ancestor who wrote the ""Star-Spangled Banner"". He was an underachiever when he was in high school but he was intelligent. He did, however, end up going to Princeton University, though he didn't graduate from there. He instead enrolled in the army in 1917. Events in Fitzgerald's life inspired him to write his most famous book, ""The Great Gatsby."" Fitzgerald died of a heart attack in 1940.The most controversial situation in ""The Great Gatsby"" was the disfunctional marraige between Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Tom was interested in a girl in New York. Daisy even knew that Tom was having an affair but she tried to love him anways. She figured that she had to because she had a baby on the way and Tom was the only life she knew.Jay Gatsby lives across the bay from Daisy. Every night, from across the bay, Gatsby watches Daisy's greenlight on her porch. Gatsby and Daisy used to love each other before Gatsby went off to war. Gatsby's absence left Daisy lonely and she married Tom. Gatsby wanted Daisy back. He tried to live the ""American Dream."" He thought this dream would bring his love back to him. Daisy, however, never heard of Gatsby's return until she was invited over to a lunch which he ""happened"" to be at. The luncheon caused Daisy and Gatsby's love to rekindle and they began to have an affair.Tom found out about the affair and he was furious with Daisy. He knew he was having an affair himself, yet he still had the nerve to tell Daisy she was wrong. Tom thought Daisy should be a faithful wife to him. This was the main conflict which caused all the problems to arise throughout the novel.This conflict really caught my attention. I felt for Daisy as she was still living the life when her husband was with another woman. I can't imagine the pain she was going through and how hard it must have been to continue to be with him. When Daisy started seeing Gatsby, I did not think she was doing the right thing. Two wrongs don't make a right. That was the feeling I had throughout the book, hurt for the way the Buchanan's chose to live their lives. Their life of cheating, lying, pretending, and settling for less then the best. I felt this way because I know there are people who really live their lives this way and I wish no one would have to go through that pain. This book has a very strong and lasting impact on the reader.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['American Dream']

Pike,9/20,2.0,1130198400,The Mediocre-at-best Gatsby,"Now I realize that most reviewers loved this book, but I just have to go with my instincts here. The book was boring. Plain and simple. None of the characters was really likeable, there was no great plot to speak of, and overall just dull in tone. Sure Fitzgerald is an accomplished writer and the novel is descriptively and grammatically great, but it takes more than that to make a classic. And sadly, this book fell far short.If you're a high school kid getting force fed this crap, you may emerge with a negative view of the book upon completion, which will mostly be greeted (from your teacher) with, ""Well, you just didn't understand it."" A little inside info for you (from a teacher). Most educators teaching this are not necesarily doing so because they personally like the book, but because some genius decided Gatsby was a classic and needed to be shoved down the throat of every kid to graduate high school. But the teachers will pretend they like it and if you didn't enjoy it they'll say you just didn't get it. Oh no, I got it all right. I just wish I hadn't. So don't feel bad if you disliked the book. There's nothing wrong with you. And I completely agree.To be fair, the book isn't awful, so I gave it 2 stars. I guess my biggest beef with it is just how ubiquitous it is in public education. It seems every single high school kid has to read books like this just because someone said it was a classic.

There was a lot of description about the period, and society behavior of the period, that didn't seem particularly relevant, and the end seemed morally ambiguous. However, much of this short novel has stuck in my mind, especially the characters, longer than other novels I read (mostly sci-fi and mysteries).It also seemed a mistake to make the protagonist a bystander with only passing reference to Gatsby during the first third of the novel. On reflection, this probably built up the mystery about the character and kept me reading. Since then I've watched the movie with Alan Ladd, and they dropped that device, bringing Gatsby in early.

Jay Gatsby, the main character in this engrossing tale of life among the party set of what has become known as the roaring twenties, is a somewhat vague shadow of a character especially when compared with the other richly portrayed personalities. Perhaps it a virtue of the book that Gatsby remain a mystery man to the reader. ""Old sport"" is a phrase overused ad nauseum and gives Gatsby a grating personal quirk that was off-putting to this reader.

Despite the infamous spellin errors, Fitzgerald really pulls off a complicated relationship that truly reveals the true ideals and values of the new American Dream.Dedicated to his wife Zelda, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a quick compilation of his passion for her, pouring out every single rush of emotion from pen to paper. After Fitzgerald's rocky relationship with Zelda, he decided to embed his experience into a book replete with mistakes as a result of his burst of emotion and fervor.The Great Gatsby argues that even if an individual is determined enough to chase a dream to the ends of the earth by any means necessary, his social status would remain the unchanged. Left with no choice, Gatsby is forced to perform illegal actions, like bootlegging, in order to gain monetary success. With this wealth, Gatsby can successfully compete with Tom and win Daisy over. However, Daisy cares not only about the wealth of her husband, but also the reputation and social status. However, the only way Gatsby was able to obtain that much wealth in a short period of time was to bootleg, an illegal action that would lower anyone's social standing. In the hierarchy of society, an individual is rarely able to move up on the social ladder. Because Gatsby had to earn his wealth through illegal means, his reputation was thus undermined. Because his goal was to win Daisy's heart, he cared less about his appearance to his contemporaries and thus sacrificed his image for his goal. Despite his determination, he was unsuccessful in that he died before he could fully experience Daisy's love, ultimately coming up short.Even though he had gained the wealth he needed, his goals were eventually hindered and obstructed, as he died without his dear love. Because the story ends as a tragedy, Gatsby represents a low social standing individual who failed to reach his goal, despite his quick path to financial success. Though he came close, he still could not hold back the repercussions of a society, in which reputation mattered as much as wealth.I recommend this book, because it's ideas are intriguing and realistic and can potentionally happen to you.",['F.

Quite simply, you must read it. I know you've heard it before: allow me to join in praising it.The first thing I'd like to point out is Fitzgerald's brilliant use of symbolism. The cars, the colors, various characters' glasses... these aren't just trivial things, you know. Pay close attention to them.Anyway, the next thing I'd like to discuss is the character of Gatsby himself. A very intriguing figure. In fact, he's a bit of an enigma to me in that I have no definite opinion on whether or not I admire him. My opinion on the other characters is clear-cut (I mostly dislike them, other than Nick - which I believe was Fitzgerald's intention, to portray the rich as shallow and irresponsible - another thing that comes off brilliantly). But Gatsby... I'm not sure on Gatsby. I have to salute him for sticking with his dream for so long, in spite of its hopelessness, but the ends of said dream would have resulted in disaster for all parties involved, and his motives would be questionable. Gatsby is charismatic, well-read, determined, and intelligent; he is also greedy, self-absorbed, and stuck in the past. In other words, very human. And that's the most intriguing part of his character: when the end comes, I am unsure whether or not I feel Gatsby deserved his fate. Something to ponder. I like books that make me think deeply, and this is one of them.As for Fitzgerald's language, let us say he has total mastery over it. I knew he was a phenomenal writer from reading a collection of his short stories before I picked up Gatsby, but nothing could prepare me for what this book would present. Fitzgerald was a very, very talented writer, and there's a fine reason why he is widely considered one of the best. Books don't get much better.As an attack on the fast, hard lifestyles of the wealthy (something Fitzgerald himself knew a lot about), and as a meditation on how time's passage can ruin lives, this is equally brilliant. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. Every character is fully fleshed out, even seemingly (but only seemingly!) trivial characters like Old Owl Eyes; the symbolism is perfect, the language is stunning, and the book is just the right length. I can think of no criticisms.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['American Dream']

I get frustrated when things are very subtle and I generally have no idea what the hell people are talking about. Which is how I felt about much of this book. It felt like people were speaking a different language...I just didn't understand it.I'm glad I finally read it and I'm really glad it was only 180 pages long.,['F.

0460872702,Great Gatsby (Everyman),,A1PASRZ81DY9C,John Doe,1/7,2.0,1240272000,Overrated.,"Ah, The Great Gatsby...you know, I've read the book three times already, and every time I did, the book is still no good. Widely regarded as a masterpiece, I think The Great Gatsby took advantage of the claim as a marketing tool in a way of generating sales. But honestly, the book is just not that darn interesting. It lacks feelings, emotions, and realism, but F. Scott Fitzgerald does well in making his characters appear as robotic, unfeeling, and uninteresting. The most surprising thing about the book is how Jay Gatsby appears to be smaller than life. Had he been portrayed as a legendary figure, my opinion of the book would have been much dramatically different. Rather, he is an ordinary guy who happens to have money. Anyhow, if I had to suggest a much better book that deals with the same themes as The Great Gatsby did, it would easily have to be The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. The Great Gatsby is dated in its details as they are also lacking of description whereas in The Bonfire of the Vanities (A Man in Full isn't too far off either) is more relevant to our times and is very revealing. I could almost taste it as if I was there, but in The Great Gatsby, it was difficult to follow the course of action at times. It could be the writing itself, but let's be honest, no matter how many revisions it will take, The Great Gatsby is not that interesting. It might be an accurate description of the Roaring Twenties, but let's face it, it was a dated era. Nevertheless, I was forced to read the book during high school and found nothing of substance. The second time I read it for pleasure during college, I still found nothing of substance. And now, I read it again for pleasure and still find absolutely nothing of substance. I want to make a comment about two things in the book. Every time Jay Gatsby calls Nick ""old sport,"" I cringe with my eyes shut. When Nick (the narrator whom I hate) suddenly said, ""I just remembered that today's my birthday,"" now...that is probably the worst moment of the book. It's just so stupidly random and so stupidly stupid. Even Sam Waterston had to pull out the Keanu Reeves moment by quoting the line. One part in the book where Jay Gatsby threw his clothes in the air, Daisy Buchanan remarked about the beautiful shirts. At that moment, I immediately flashbacked to Mia Farrow's over-the-top performance and wondered if I could get a glass ball from the dance club and whirl it above her. All in all, it is safe to say that The Great Gatsby has been vastly overrated over the years.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['American Dream']

Thankfully those days are already almost behind us due to the recent publication of a few books, Dr. Karp's and the No Cry Sleep Solution, by Elizabeth Pantley. We own both, and while both are good, personally we prefer the No Cry Sleep Solution. Perhaps its the fact that the book is written by a mother of four and parent educator, not a doctor. Her approach and writing style make you rightfully feel as though you're being taught by a learned friend who wants nothing more than to see you and your baby healthy, happy, and above all, rested. The Happiest Baby was useful, but it simply didn't grab us the same way. As an analogy, No Cry is like taking a stain from shirt with the advice from the Queen of Clean, as opposed to the head of the New York Department of Sanitation.

It's somewhat plausible, and an okay explanation for why some babies are colicky, but as a first-time parent, I don't really care. What I care about is knowing some practical things for dealing with a fussy baby. I bought the book mainly to prepare myself now for ""what if"" rather than having to deal with an extremely fussy or colicky baby when I'm sleep deprived. I have also been a nanny for two different families, and I'm very familiar with fussy babies... but this time I won't be able to go home at the end of the day! I rated this book four out of five stars because I think it's WAY too long. I think Dr. Karp's five steps to calming a colicky baby can be adequately explained in ten pages, not 260. Or, in the very least, subsequent editions should have a pull-out laminated guide or something, because I can't imagine trying to root through the book to figure out the gist of his message while holding a screaming baby!

It is an ultimate classic that everyone must read! What makes this book so great? Charolette Brontes wonderful skill, of making the characters so real, is what makes this book a classic. She describes Jane in such a way, that everyone can find a bit of themselves in her, and often can relate to her thoughts, and her feelings. Her inocence, just seems to surround her. She has such a pure love, a pure want, and yet she is so inocent, that we long to be like her. Her inteligence and pride, add to her, and make her a prominent figure in our minds. With out Charolette Bronte's wonderful depiction of Jane, this book would not be near as powerful as it is now. The romance in this novel, makes you wan to reach out and hug Jane. You wan tto tell her that everything will be all right, and with the hard life that she had suffered through, when she finds love, you want to cry for her. As the Climax of the book arrives, you find yourself reading, with a tear sliding slowly down you cheek. You feel you eyes fill up as you want to weep with her. YOu want her to know you are there. with out the romance, that touches your heart, this book could not be the same, and would not touch the heart in the same way. The simplicity of theh plot, helps to make the book a hit. If this book were not simple and plain, it would become a bore, but it is nothing more than a young girls life, as she grows, her terrible treatment from her aunt, her schooling, and her first love. This book is so simple that it is almost amazing.Clearly this book is wondeful. You will find your self reading it over and over again! I suggest it to all of those who enjoy a good romance, with lots of love and hope!",['Charlotte Brontë'],

At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night.

I looked at the beautiful cover and said, this looks interesting. I know you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, so before I got it, I read the first chapter. I was instantly in a world of my own which only inhabited a young girl named, Jane Eyre. I got it out as fast as I could and started to get far away from the world, in this book. I read it constantly, not wanting to put it down. I was surrounded by mystery and passion and thrills all at the same time. The characters were so life-like that I felt like I was standing right next to them, observing them from every angle. It was the most, thrilling experience I've ever had from a book besides 'Little Women.' The writing, it's so creative and follows the rules of realism and describation and the beautiful flow of language. I just couldn't believe that the whole story was fiction and was made up in the author's mind. It seems that it actually happened. This book is a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you are just missing out. I would like anyone who wants to be inspired to write read Ms. Charlotte Bronte's words. Since I'm a writer, it has helped me so much. But, if you are not a writer, I would still recommend it to readers who like to be immersed in books. Everyone should read this!!",['Charlotte Brontë'],

After she finishes school, shereceives a job as a governess in a place called Thornfield for a younggirl named Adele.

All in all, I felt this novel was aseptic, boresome, anddry.If you are seeking a dull, dry novel to read, this is a book foryou. I was always waiting for something exhilarating to occur, but itnever did. If Jane Eyre does seem interesting, I suggest renting themovie, it isn't half bad because many of the tedious parts of the novelwere cut out.

I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time.

While I have read gothic works like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelly's ""Frankenstein,"" Wuthering Heights tramples them with it's intense passion of the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine.

It is set ing the moors of old England. Cathy and Heathcliff are two lovers, but when Cathy marries Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton, he vows revenge on both of them.

The plot is so well writing, it keeps you guessing at every turn.This book is written in the perspective of Nelly (Ellen) Dean. She is the care taker to Cathy through out the book, and one of Heathcliff's close friends. The theme has many interpretation, but I think the most noticeable is of the jealousy Heathcliff feels towards Edgar.

Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.Boy, was I wrong.Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost likeHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1),A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up.",['Emily Bronte'],

From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial.

There is no fighting spirit, no desire to improve their condition, just the vague hope that someone will come along and miraculously provide food, shelter, and most importantly alcohol to keep the children and parents going. At best, it serves merely to reinforce the stereotype of the Irish as lazy, drunk irresponsible and undereducated.

Hell, I challenge anyone describing this as their history to make it sound upbeat. The truth was a story in itself and it has occured many times over throughout our human history. That he survived in an indifferent world was uplifting. I have many connections to this. I come from a long line of passionate, creative people who love and live hard. Many of them have made the mistakes of McCourt's father and mother. A handful have gone to succeed like the author and his siblings. But the very best was Frank McCourts opening. The first few paragraphs of the book set the stage nicely. In short, he says a happy childhood may not have the worth of a difficult one. Hard beginnings have created some of the best characters out there. I'm sure I would be a very different person myself if I came from &quot;soft&quot; beginnings. But I did not.

We root for Frankie and he does not disappoint. The language is raw and the narrative pure, he relates the ugliness in life and his own adaptive nature; perhaps that's why it succeeds despite some of the controversy it stirred up.Thank you McCourt for the insight into a childhood of hardship and adversity as well as into my father's own life.When I asked my uncle at the funeral about their tough childhood and poverty, he said, ""We were mobile, we realized we didn't have to stay in this life.

The protagonist, Frank McCourt, is the oldest of eight children. His parents are Malachaly, who is described as ""shiftless, loquacious, and alcoholic,"" and his mother, Angela, whom McCourt calls, ""pious, big-hearted, and overwhelmed."" The big Irish family soon has to leave their home in Brooklyn and moves to Limerick after the tragic death of their beloved daughter, Margaret, just as the Great Depression takes hold in America. Their home in Ireland isn't ideal to the family; their rented flat is a complete rat's nest and they share one bathroom with all their neighbors. For years, the family only eats bread and tea because that is all they can afford on their welfare money, when Mr. McCourt doesn't take it all and use it to get drunk. Eventually, the kids have to steal food just to get through one more day; they even become beggars on the streets at times. Life in Ireland for the family is very brutal and harsh as the Great Depression and their own father's self-destructiveness swallows up their hopes as well on the other side of the Atlantic.Though the storyline is sad and heartbreaking, Frank McCourt does an amazing job brightening up the memoir at times. ""Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael . . . wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane."" This is an example of McCourt taking a deep and dark moment and using humor to lighten it up. This moment is very symbolic to Angela's dreams and shows how the family struggles for food on a daily basis. As I was reading this passage (insert a comma here) I tried figure out why the title is Angela's Ashes, I think I've figured it out but I won't ruin it for you. While reading Mr. McCourt's remembrance, it was clear money was always an issue for the family, but after finishing the book, I realized that money wasn't the real conflict. Family, loving one another, and being together are the true conflicts that the family endures the entire book. The father is unable to find a job in Ireland and travels far away to work, he promises to send money but he is never heard from and trying to feed eight hungry children is difficult for Angela. This broken family sticks together and battles their miserable lives in multiple homes that they stay at throughout the town of Limerick.At first, this book was both depressing and sad, but as I read through it, I saw more than that and discovered that it has more of a deep and a more underlying meaning than I thought it would. From reading this compelling memoir, I got a better understanding of how life can be so cruel but yet the McCourt family managed to carry on with little food and thin clothing during harsh winters. At one point, I got sucked into the book and I felt like I was one of the eight kids searching through dumpsters trying to find any scraps of food, and yet I managed to laugh at the funny and nave things the younger kids say. I don't think I've read a tome that has ever made me feel so many different emotions. As one reviewer wrote when McCourt's book came out, ""It brings tears and smiles together as close as they can ever be.""",['Abraham Verghese'],['Fiction']

I read this book and thought it was really funny. I lived outside the US at the time in an underdeveloped country and my work mates thought it depressing. I thought - it must be me. Later, I asked my mom what she thought (being the child of Irish Americans who were born at the turn of the 20th century). She thought it was funny. I then chalked it up to my family having an odd sense of humor or just my own maligned memories of my childhood visiting with my super elderly Irish great aunts and uncles in New York/Newark who had a similar sense of humor. I then returned to the US and began to work with another Irish American, older than I, whose Irish-American wife read it. She thought it funny too. Then I realized that it must be an Irish American thing, this odd, dry sense of humor even in the worst situations. So, conclusion is that if you don't like a dry sense of humor in the face of very difficult times, then this book isn't for you. But if you can find humor in the more dire of circumstances, this book is absolutely for you. Good reading.",['Abraham Verghese'],['Fiction']

He lives in terrible poverty in a very wet, dieseased, dirty Ireland, and loses siblings left and right. This book will dry up every ounce of water in your body and make you laugh terribly hard at the same time. The sorrow Frank McCourt goes through is unimaginable, but still seems to include humor into his book. The sing songy way of writing and the run on sentences have a poetic way about them. Reading Frank McCourt working his way to getting to America with all of his struggles and setbacks really make an impression on a reader. The book is a great overwhelming combonation of happiness as sadness with near perfection. Imagining such a lifehood is like a fantasy. -TGS",['Abraham Verghese'],['Fiction']

Pierce ""avid reader""",0/0,4.0,1281225600,"Good story, not keen on ending","I'm an avid reader, and after much critical and popular acclaim, I read Angela's Ashes, and was not disappointed. By now most people know what the story is about. I for one didn't love the style in which it was written, almost as a stream of consciousness, with not much use for puncutation and I found that distracting at first. It written in the first person present tense, which I agree with other reviews gives the reader the notion that this is happening now, and the events are described to you through the eyes and voice of this child.I came away with the impression that Angela is the reluctant hero in the boy's eyes. She was not, it seemed to be, a mother who moved mountains with her sheer will and determination for her family, but rather she did what had to be done, knowing there was noone else who would do it besides her, since her husband was an alcoholic who could not keep down a job for very long and drank what little money he made. I found curious the comment that young Frankie made about how they may not have had enough money to buy a little food, but that ""Mam always had her"" cigarettes. I also found it interesting that Frankie didn't make similar comments about his father. He speaks of his father as if he understands he is a broken man, and that he doesn't mean to disappoint his family, that he doesn't intentionally do the things he does. Frankie reminisces fondly of the time he spends with his father on his lap, listeneing to his very imaginative stories, or spending time with him early in the morning before everyone else gets up, so he has his father all to himself. He never speaks of his mother that way, and I wonder why. Is it because he knows his mother is too consumed with misery and worry over where their next barely adequate meal will come from, where the rent money will come from, to be able to enjoy such moments with her children? I suppose that's what we are meant to infer. I didn't appreciate the ending, the not knowing what happens to his mother and his brothers after Frankie leaves for America. It seemed rather abrupt the way the novel ended, with him saving enough money for his boat trip to America. We don't know what becomes of him afterwards, but i suppose that's so we will buy the next book 'Tis.All in all, I did enjoy this memoir. It is an uplifting story, one that should make 90% of us in this country hug our children closer and thank God in Heaven that we didn't share Frank McCourt's background.",['Abraham Verghese'],['Fiction']

Smith ""Julie @ Knitting and Sundries""",0/0,5.0,1295827200,Heartbreaking and humorous,"How do you tell a tale of a poverty-stricken upbringing with humor and grace? Frank McCourt does it in his memoir in a way that will keep you turning pages long after the last time you said to yourself, ""I really must put this book down and get ... done.""After the tragic loss of his 7-week-old sister Margaret, Frank's family (dad, mom, 3-year-old brother Malachy and 1-year-old twins Oliver and Eugene) moves back to Ireland when Frank is four. They are promptly turned away from their paternal grandparents' house and sent to Dublin, where they are told that Frank's father should be able to get some compensation for having fought for Ireland's cause. This turns out to be untrue, and, penniless, they end up at the police station, where only the kindness of the officers gives them the money they need to continue to their maternal grandmother's home.Frank's father is a drunkard from Northern Ireland who can't keep a job longer than the third paycheck, and even the dole money he is given when out of work winds up going to drink rather than to feeding his family. They live with fleas, in a unit that floods on the lower level, forcing them to spend much of their time upstairs.The reader finds out about the peculiar prejudice of the southern Irish against those of the North, easily distinguishable by their accents, and also about the injustice bred by poverty. We see Frank and his family going hungry while other families eat, and Frank wishing that someone else could be his mother simply because then he could always have mashed potatoes or soup. Siblings sicken and die, and his mother is shamefully reduced to begging for scraps to feed her children. Other fathers go to England to work, as does Frank's father, but, unlike the other fathers, no money is sent to his family. In spite of Frank's intelligence and the recommendation of his schoolmaster, Frank is turned away as an altar boy due to his poverty, and other doors are closed to him as well.In spite of it all, there is hope and laughter in this novel. There are people we want to punch, and people we want to hug. There is the small joy of having enough to buy a piece of candy or go to the movie, and the larger joy of sometimes having a full meal or a couple of coins in your pocket.This is a tug-at-your-heart, in your face look at a hardscrabble life that many of us couldn't imagine, written by someone who falls in love with the words of Shakespeare and with Wodehouse novels while recovering from typhoid fever in the hospital. It is a tale that all readers will love, and I highly recommend it for anyone's shelves.QUOTESShe says that if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine.That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore.

He kept so much to himself I didn't have many interactions with him. He sat on a stool in the corner of his brother Alphie's restaurant/bar on the Upper West Side of New York City, where I worked, sipping a glass of something, always alone. This was a decade before he published Angelia's Ashes. If one word described him then it would be ""calm,"" although I once heard him refer to a bar customer as ""a bloody Englishman."" He was quiet, polite, his gray hair well barbered, his clothes always neat. The loudest thing about him was his Irish face, which for all the McCourts shouted ""Mickey."" Sometimes Frank's brother Malachy came in and there would be three McCourts at the bar together. Whenever a McCourt brother was asked a question he raised his eyebrows and stared off into the distance several seconds to ponder, pursed his lips, then answered in a resigned sigh as if loath to let go of the words. This was usually followed with an ironic joke of some sort and then maybe a ""Hah, hah!"", with the accent on the last ""hah."" Frank was an okay guy. All the McCourts were sociable sorts.I never suspected Frank had a rugged childhood because there wasn't a hint of it in his demeanor. In his memoir he describes being one of an underclass of County Limerick poor (some of whom today contest the veracity of his memories) who were destitute and starving in the 1930s and 40s, living on tea and bread bought from the public dole. The McCourts' father, Frank writes, could not go three weeks without spending all his wages on an alcoholic binge, losing his job as a result. Their father left for work in London during WWII and seldom sent his family back anything, presumably drinking what he made and lying in English gutters on the weekends. The harsh nature of Irish culture in Limerick at that time exacerbated the shame and humiliation felt by the McCourts for being destitute.I have a feeling that, like all good autobiographies, some events and characters in Frank's book were enlarged, some reduced, others adjusted and sculptured to focus and shape the narrative. If George Orwell did that sort of thing in books like Down and Out in Paris and London then Frank McCourt deserves the same latitude. Frank certainly re-spun the dialogue from what he remembered, aided by years being as aspiring writer and playwright. Be that as it may, the text rings true and it is a thoroughly enjoyable book, narrated well by its writer. It's a tribute to endurance and decidedly a book worth reading or listening to.",['Abraham Verghese'],['Fiction']

Either he has an amazing memory or, more likely, he's embellished a bit of this to fill in the gaps to make it a readable memoir. I can't remember what I ate for breakfast, never mind what I ate or longed to eat for breakfast when I was wee child.The book reads like a novel and I quickly forgot it was a first hand account of growing up in a slum with absolutely nothing but an exhausted mum, a lush of a dad who can't keep a job and a slew of younger siblings who seem to die off as soon as the next one is born. Frank grows up quickly because mom is tired, dad is lazy and he and his younger brother must take of the younger kids, scour the lane for bits of coal to keep his family warm, steal bits of food to survive and then face cruelty at school. The book is pretty grim but compelling enough that I wanted to continue reading to see how Frank makes it out alive.I've seen criticism that this book is a one-sided view of Ireland during the depression and from what I read it looks like that is true. Many times in the book the author points out that other boys had shoes and weren't eating a pig head for Christmas dinner but the author gets away with it because he is writing from his experience and not of the experience of the boy with the full belly and hard-working father.This was a thoroughly compelling, wryly funny, and often tragic read.

It takes place in the fabled Maine town of Derry, the town from Bag of Bones and he talks about Shawshank State Prison. But that's not important. He also carries over plots(to an extent) and themes. The quest of the kids is much like the quest of the kids in &quot;The Body&quot; and It, although infinitely more malevolent, reminds me of the ghosts of Bag of Bones.

Stephen King does and excellent job of disconfusing the facts that are from present to past. This book will scare you.Trust me, it will scare you.The scary discriptions of the murders and the Penneywise really make this book a great and addictive page turner and the characters child and grown up details are increadible, wich makes this book over 1,000 pages long. I got the book at the library 2 nights ago, and after the first night, I could barely walk the next day I was so tired for reasons A)I could not stop reading and B) I was scared [witless] thinking Pennywise was looking at me through the window.The imagination of Stephen King is increadable. Increadable. This is a must own book for any hardcore reader. ( I just finished it 2 hours ago.)If there is one complaint about the book, it would definetly be the mediocre editing.

So he calls all his friends, and back in 1958 they all made a promise that they will come back to fight IT again.So they come back (minus Stan because he slits his wrists in the bathtub while spelling IT in his own blood and his wife discover's his corpse.) and recollect the memories of that summer.I dont want to give away the ending because that would just destroy the book, but read it nontheless.

When the movie came out I was sorely disappointed because it just didn't do the story justice. As an author of four novels myself, I must say that the book is always better than the movie. If you've never read any of Stephen King's books, you don't know what you're missing. This novel, in particular, will give you a whole new insight on clowns, for one thing, but better yet, you will see Stephen King at his most creative best!Joyce Marie Taylor, Author and Poet",,
0670813028,It,,AJOLE7WLNKFYM,JayStizzle,4/8,1.0,1354838400,Seriously?? That was It????,"I was very eager to read this novel. I have read many books, works of fiction and non-fiction, however this was my first time reading a Stephen King novel. Being around the Halloween time period I was in the mood to be SCARED. Who better than Stephen King to get me in the spirit? With so many glowing reviews on so many of his books I thought that maybe this could be the start of something beautiful, a Stephen King reading spree. I chose IT as my introduction novel because perhaps more than any of his books this seemed to have the most praise.Very rarely will I give a book a 1 star review. I have a great appreciation for authors and can't imagine how intelligent one must be to craft a story and a world so dense and lifelike. That being said, this book was a farce. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. Reasons as follows:- IT'S NOT SCARY. Not once during this book did I feel afraid of anything. Isn't that the supposed staple of Stephen King? No tense moments, no fear to read the next sentence, NOTHING!- Tired literary techniques. This book uses all the textbook tricks of cliffhangers. Hinting at something mysterious that makes no sense, coming back to mention it 200 pages later with ever so slightly more detail, and then another 200 pages later, etc. I understand this part of literature, and I don't always despise it....But when the majority of a novel is made up of this technique AND all of these ""secrets"" turn out to be something utterly disappointing...you feel cheated.- One dimensional characters. I am probably a little picky on my characters. I want them to be real people containing elements of good and bad, heroism and humility. Not here. Everyone in this book comes out of a can. You've got the class clown, the bully, the abusive father, the stuttering hero. It was very hard to relate to anyone as a REAL PERSON.- It's too long. I did read the whole novel. This review is not written based on me giving up after a couple hundred pages. That being said, once I finished it was clear to me that probably half the book could have been omitted. I also feel that certain portions of the story should have been enhanced to greater detail. Too much time and effort was spent on insignificant plot while other elements clearly deserved more detail and explaining.*SPOILER ALERT*- The gang bang (or ""running train"") on an 11 year old girl. Let me say that I have no problem with gratuitous sex in literature. I really have a very low filter for everything I read. Never have I come across something and turned away because it was offensive or over the top. This however, was completely unnecessary to the story arc. I really have no idea why this was in the book at all. To garner attention or controversy? To hopefully sell more copies? When I made it to this passage I was actually laughing out loud because I had realized how absurd the novel had become at this point.I am truly confused on how this book has so many fantastic reviews. Maybe it's the same reason that the top ranked shows on television are ""American Idol"" and ""Honey Boo Boo"". Do people just fall in love with trash?My advice - If you are a true fan of literature and story building. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. I won't be dipping my toe in anything Stephen King ever again.",,

This hardcover also explains the settings and characters that were similar to Dickens' own life.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's refreshing in this day and age to see a moralistic tale written without reference to religious symbolism. To me, the message under the story is so much more universally delivered this way because people with all different belief systems still get the transformation that Scrooge undergoes.I also love the concept embedded in the story about how rapidly a person can change. Unlike in Dickens' time, today we have the science to prove that if you want to change your life, all you have to do is change your mind.

Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth. Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes. The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment. They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge. He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment. He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate. Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesn&#65533;t trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly. It is the only pleasure he allows himself. He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different. Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off. Despite this, Bob is a happy man. He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home. The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, &#65533;but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.&#65533;The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit. His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man. He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man. Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience. His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family. He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed. A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers. His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others.",,

I immediatly made all of my friends read it, all of whom also became hooked. This book painted a picture of the Royal Court that I had never imagined in my wildest dreams. At the time, the birth of a girl was a dissapointment. Ironically for these families however, its the girls who are used as pawns in the royal game to advance their families and make them rich. This book brings all of this to life as well as tells the story of the little-known Mary Boleyn, sister to the infamous Anne. Mary accepted her role as a pawn reluctantly, and only to obey her father and uncle. Anne embraced this role with open arms and exceeded her families expectations, as she tirelessly schemed for her place on the throne and in history. This is a wonderful twist on what you thought you knew about the tudor court and will undoubtedly make you want more.

0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A36USMIZGFO19N,Julia Rose,1/1,5.0,1135814400,Historical Fiction At Its' Best,"Historical fiction is an art. To write a great piece, you must have not only engaging characters, but a vivid painting of the times, and a focus on the events of the time instead of just the characters itself.The Other Boleyn Girl is just this. I have always been fascinated with Tudor England, and am always looking for new books to read. I have read good and bad, but this is truly one of the best.One of the most unique things is that the perspective is not told from Anne, but her sister Mary. In all of the other books, Mary is just a characature with no real place in the story. In this, she is placed front and center as she tells of her reign as King Henry VIII mistress, her fierce rivalry between her sister, and the illusion of the court, where everything looks perfect, but scandal and backstabbing reign. As a result of this, a compelling and very likable character is created.The writing is so vivid in this work, that you can see the court in your mind. You can picture the palaces, the intricate dresses, and the chess game that the Tudor court always was.I love how the court was portrayed as an illusion in this work, and how it was indeed a chess game, where you could be the queen one day, and not even a pawn the next, depending on how you played your move. Also greatly addressed are the difficulties of being a woman in the times, and how they were simply pawns in a man's kingdom.Above all though, I greatly enjoyed how the the whole Boleyn family was given life. I won't give it all away here, but you are given such a different perspective and a longing to know more.While this seems like a long book at six hundred plus pages, it is also a fast read that is very entertaining to pass the time with, while learning even more about Tudor England. Phillipa Gregory is a fantastic story teller, where the words come to life, and you are transported to an entirely different world. Now that, is historical fiction!Also a great book for reading groups, and anyone who is interested in, or wants to know more about this compelling and fragile time in history.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']
0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A3MVSKVD3XGIJO,"Elizabeth Palmer ""History Lass""",1/1,5.0,1136246400,Brilliant insight into a little known historical figure,"I had great expectations while opening this book and I was not disappointed. I have often wondered what Mary Boleyn thought during her sister, Anne's, rise and downfall. This book provided Philippa Gregory's account of what she may have thought and done.It was interesting to find a novel about Henry VIII or Anne Boleyn told by another character. And I have to say it was great to get a not so sympathetic account of Anne Boleyn. She comes across as scheming and manipulative and not very nice. So it's probably not a good book for die-hard Anne Boleyn fans. By telling the story from the point of view of Mary, we can see this different (perhaps more realistic) view of Anne.I was disappointed, however, that the ending did not include more details on how she felt about Anne's death (and that of her brother, George). I would have like to see more introspection from Mary and thoughts about whether she could have ended the same way.The book was very well researched and it also gives some rare glimpses into the court of Henry VIII.A wonderful book that kept me reading all day. I was sad to reach the end.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']
0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A2GCCVXI3LOQDE,T.F.,19/23,3.0,1137196800,Don't think this book has much to do with history.,"If you approach this book as being almost purely fiction, you'll be fine - because that's what it is. Phillipa Gregory has taken enormous liberties with what few facts there are about Mary Boleyn, including her place in the birth order of the Boleyn family and her age when she returned to the Tudor court after being raised in the French court. Most likely Mary Boleyn was not married at thirteen and did not become Henry's mistress at fourteen, and her reputation as a woman of loose morals while she lived at the French court is well documented. It is possible that her first child was Henry's (though there is considerable doubt about this), but her second child most probably was not. Her second marriage, traditionally thought to be for love alone, might also have been a shrewd attempt on Mary's (and possibly her family's) part to get her out of the picture at the time when Anne Boleyn had obviously begun to fall from grace and was likely to take members of her wildly ambitious family with her.One frustrating aspect of all historical fiction is the application of modern thought and modern philosophy to the characters of people who lived at other times in history. Mary's frequent feminist musings about the ""plight"" of women in the Tudor era is probably entirely Gregory's imagination. Such thoughts and ideas simply did not exist in Tudor times. Girls in Mary Boleyn's position were raised from the cradle with not so much as a notion that there was any life possible for them other than arranged marriage, and their sole purpose in that marriage was to produce children, preferably male, and to advance their families in any way that they could. There was no remote possibility of self-determination - they were strictly the instruments of their fathers before marriage and their husbands after marriage. When authors attribute modern feministic thought to Anne and Mary Boleyn (Gregory is not the only author to have done this by a long shot), they are taking the wildest liberty of all with history and the social mores and practices of the time.Most historical fiction tends to lose me when modern words, like ""sexy"" are added into the thought processes or speech of characters living in times like the Tudor era. This is simply sloppy writing and thinking on the part of the author - a blatant attempt to ""update"" things for the modern reader. The word didn't exist then. Sure, there were probably words that meant the same thing during the 1500's, but ""sexy"" is a modern invention. It sets the teeth on edge if the reader has much knowledge of the era the book is purportedly set in.If you approach this as strictly fiction, based loosely on rather spurious historical fact (almost nothing is really known of Mary Boleyn, and since Henry had most images and belongings of Anne Boleyn destroyed after her execution, information about Anne, including her real birthdate and her actual appearance, is vague as well), it's an interesting read. Just don't think it's any kind of accurate portrayal of Tudor women or life in Tudor times - or even of the historical records that do exist. Much manipulation has been applied to the facts to make Mary younger than she probably was at the time, and to ""justify"" her actions (her supposed devotion to Katherine of Aragon in the book is a case in point). Mary Boleyn would have had no will of her own - if her father had directed her to attract the attention of Henry VIII (and there is no proof that this was the case) or if the King had decided that she would be his mistress, that was what would happen - period. She would have had absolutely no say in the matter, and likely would not have even considered her position as royal mistress in any way wrong or harmful to Katherine of Aragon.Take the book with a grain of salt, and enjoy it as fiction. Perhaps it will make you curious and ready to read more about the real lives and times of the people involved.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']

0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,AJ4IKZ8R989Y6,Abbie,1/1,4.0,1143331200,Mysteriously Fantastic!,"One thing I have definitely learned from reading The Other Boleyn Girl is that there is no difference between love and death while trying to satisfy a king of his needs. The main character is Mary Boleyn and during the book, she searches for true love but also to escape the royal court and live a simpler life. The way Philippa Gregory created her characters makes it to where they have such depth it is impossible to describe. Mary's feelings are the highlight of her character: betrayed by Anne, her ruthless sister, betraying others, anger, and love. Some other characters are Anne Boleyn, Mary's evil sister willing to sacrifice anything to receive what she wants; George Boleyn, Mary's close brother and a good servant to the king; and King Henry VIII, a king who courts both Boleyn girls but does not care about the fate of his own country as long as he can get his hands on one other whores. The Other Boleyn Girl is also the prequel to The Queen's Fool.A basic outline of the plot: the country of England is in trouble when King Henry VIII cannot stick with one woman after discovering how much power he truly holds. This historical fiction's theme is to serve your royalty (king and queen) is betrayal towards yourself while doing what is right is treason to the king (while in a dictatorship). Philippa Gregory's writing style is similar to J.K. Rowling's due to the fact they have both written stories that take place in England.I loved the book because there was always something disturbing or hysterical, and once I started furthering my position in the book, I could not put it down. I felt happy, sad, revengeful, and satisfied during The Other Boleyn Girl. A recommendation for other readers interested: make sure a mature reader comes to understand the book and ignore the disturbing parts. Philippa Gregory wrote such a great story that I often had to stop reading because I actually felt and thought I was right there as Mary, also the narrator of the tale. Gregory has written other great novels such as the Wideacre trilogy: Wideacre, The Favored Child, and Meridon. Something to remember from The Other Boleyn Girl- rebels are not always as bad as they seem and once in awhile, try taking it from their view of the story.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']

If you are a person who has read a book called historical fiction, I would caution you against reviewing that book unless you actually know something about the subject.

0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A84LC3KOVHUFV,"Professor Hermione ""profhermy""",16/19,1.0,1205539200,Wading through (Sexist) Sewage,"I would like to join other readers who have identified this novel for what it is: tawdry, sensationalistic, and grossly inaccurate.First, I should say that as a college literature professor I appreciate the challenges of rendering history as fiction. The historical novelist has to use her or his imagination to convey the inner life of historical characters, not to mention inventing some purely fictional ones. Also, streamlining and changes in the historical record are inevitable when forcing actual events into the tight structure of fiction.Still, how would one feel if one read a historical novel about Anne Frank that represented her as surviving into old age? Wouldn't that be a gross distortion of the historical record? A historical novelist has responsibilities as well as rights.Other irate reviewers of The Other Boleyn Girl have pointed out the novel's egregious inaccuracies and distortions. Just a note on this subject before moving on: I knew we were in trouble from the first scene, which shows us an execution on Tower Green (and later in the novel the men accused of adultery with Anne are executed there too). Almost all executions of the period took place on Tower Hill, not Tower Green. Tower Green was reserved for a handful of executions, mostly of victims with links to the royal family (Anne herself, Katherine Howard, Lady Jane Grey). OK, it's a small thing, compared to the more horrific errors Gregory makes, but it says something that she couldn't even be bothered to research a fairly basic and well-known fact. Not a good sign.(By the way, I will not address the even more ghastly historical distortions of the movie, except to say that the film makes Gregory's story even more cartoonish.)Actually, what I'd like to focus on here is the novel's disturbing misogyny. It's bad enough to reduce such a significant moment in English history to a catfight. Even worse, though, are the sexist stereotypes that structure the narrative. There's the sweet young thing whose sole desire is true love; then there's the rapacious shrew with political ambition. Guess who we're supposed to prefer? This novel's about as subtle in its ideological bias as the movie Fatal Attraction. Needless to say, the Bad Powerful Woman gets her comeuppance while the Good Unambitious Girl is rewarded with romantic love. Is anyone gagging as violently as I am?And, yes, how offensive to show Anne actually committing incest. As my husband pointed out, this is like portraying the victims of Stalin's show trials as really guilty. No self-respecting historian believes any of the dirt thrown at Anne; as the Lord Mayor of London remarked after her trial, he could see nothing in any of it but that they were out to get rid of her. Anne was accused of having sex with men who weren't actually anywhere in the palaces she was staying; she was accused of having sex right after Elizabeth's birth, when that wouldn't have been physically possible, etc. The incest and witchcraft accusations were cooked up to vilify her so completely that people wouldn't protest the shabby way in which a crowned Queen of England was murdered so that her husband could marry another woman already waiting in the wings.Anne was no saint, but she doesn't deserve this gratuitous vilification. But Gregory wanted to throw in lots of kinky sex and shock value that would sell, hence the peculiar sensation of wading through sewage one gets when reading this novel .Again, though, the sleaze is inextricably linked to the misogyny. As a feminist scholar I was particularly revolted at the hypocrisy of Gregory's claim that she was inspired by Retha Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn. Warnicke--a feminist Renaissance historian--argues that Anne's death must have been linked to rumors stemming from her miscarriage in early 1536; Warnicke thinks Anne's fetus must have appeared deformed to spawn the witchcraft accusations. Now Warnicke is a very fine scholar in a lot of ways, but this theory unfortunately has no evidence to support it. For instance, the one actual reference to the miscarried fetus describes it as having the appearance of a male; if it were deformed, wouldn't that have been noted? Still, Warnicke came up with her theory, unsubstantiated as it was, because she thought it reflected the kind of misogyny that, in that era, would define a powerful woman as a witch. What outrages me about Gregory's manipulation of Warnicke's theory is that she uses it in order to propagate the kind of misogyny Warnicke is criticizing. In the novel, Anne is a monster and of course (especially after incest with her brother) she spawns monster babies.Honestly, I wish this site had a no-star rating available; one star for this novel seems overly generous.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']
0753113880,The Other Boleyn Girl,,A2JVFSM9JWJ99Y,S. Bolton,14/16,1.0,1205625600,Tudor Harlequin Romance,"I did not begin reading this novel expecting anything other than an easy weekend read, but was more disappointed than I could have imagined. An educated reader knows that in historical fiction, real characters are blended with fictional ones, and events are created or recreated to advance the plot. If the plot and writing are good, then the reader may suspend the facts momentarily for the sake of the work. In this novel, however, the historical inaccuracy and writing are so far-fetched as to cause the reader to pause frequently, thus interrupting the flow of the story.If the book is about Mary (older sister, younger sister - historians in dispute), we are not given a very accurate picture of her true nature. There are established facts about Mary, such as that she was considered loose and had affairs with several men (including King Francis I of France, who called her ""a great whore, the most infamous of all"") which led to her dismissal from the French court. She was not the simpering dolt portrayed in the book.The other interuption for me was the language. In places the dialogue represented the crisp, well-versed language one would expect of courtiers, while in others I felt like I was overhearing 21st century teenagers at the mall. One pet peeve of mine is the overuse of a word or phrase throughout a work. I feel that the writer simply could not bother to think of other descriptors or was unable to. For example, Gregory uses the word 'sulk' (not a bad word if used a time or two) and every other variant of the verb...'sulky' (adj - not very good word choice), and the worst...'sulkily' (adv. - I wasn't even sure these last two were real words - they are- but she uses this adverb form over and over. I actually wanted to go back and count how many times she used it.) Another instance of questionable usage was ""D'you?"" This was always used in dialogue, and I don't know if it was intended to be the recreation of a commonly used diction of the time. If it is not, it doesn't seem to fit in with the otherwise learned, courtly, formal speech used in every other case. In actual speech the pronunciation of ""D'you"" is probably much the same as ""Do you."" No where else is diction implied, so this contraction seems unnecessary and anachronistic.At best the reading of this novel may inspire readers to become more informed about the Tudor period and the actual historical effects of the events in the book, which reduces the history to a mere backdrop for the unseemly behavior of a greedy and two-dimensional family. There are some excellent websites devoted to this period. You may find the portraits of the actual participants quite interesting as well.Worse books have, of course, been written. For that reason only, perhaps this one deserves two stars - one and a half. Judging by sales, many people like Harlequin Romances. This book is probably a fair success on that level.Unfortunately, I can't recommend this book as anything other than a Harlequin Romance, complete with heaving bosoms, soap-opera dialogue, and predictable, static characters.",['Philippa Gregory'],['Fiction']

I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time!Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as ""He was executed the next day."" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it?In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said ""stuff"" back then, for example, as in, ""All this stuff is making me mad."" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect.

It is not a real page turner because you want to find out what happens in the story (the story of Henry VIII is well known), but you immediately empathize with Mary Boleyn and want her to find her own way in a world where women are not valued except for their ability to further the family's ambitions for wealth and power or create a son for Henry VIII.The Other Boleyn Girl is narrated first person by Mary Boleyn. The characters are well developed for the three Bolyen siblings - Mary, Ann and George. Although all three of them are thrust into the crazy inner workings of the court of Henry VIII, they all have different challenges and reactions to their own family's ambitions as well as the greed, corruption, immorality and narcissism of the court of Henry VIII.It's interesting to see the story of Anne Boleyn from a different perspective and the author does a great job of telling the story through the eyes of the less infamous sister.

I never really sensed a condescending tone by the authors....what I do remember, however, is reading certain items and thinking, yeah, right, ok , whatever! and going on. The authors can be a bit preachy, but I think the intent was good, if not always very REALISTIC. In particular: feel free to read and then dismiss the Best Odds Diet Chapter. I am one of the moms who abstained from caffeine, alcohol, nutrasweet, etc....because it was easy and I wanted my baby to have the best chance possible. However, I certainly never avoided sugars and the like. Don't we all have the common sense to know to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet of fruits, veggies, whole grains and the like? And if we do that MOST of the time, how can an occasional (ok, everyday for those in the last trimester) treat like ice cream or chocolate hurt? In fact, I would be willing to prove it's HELPFUL. We're pregnant, after all, not stupid. The rest of the book was well worthwhile. Dietary advice here is well-meant but overdue as it was written for a woman pregnant during the 1950's.

0761125493,"What to Expect When You're Expecting, 3rd Edition",,,,0/4,5.0,1066608000,"All you need to know, Not too scary","This review is in response to the many negative reviews for this book. I read this book for a class that I took in university, as I am studying child and family studies. My professor and many of the students agreed that the best thing about this book is everything is in it. It says almost everything you need to know. The downside is that everything is in it. It says everything that can possibly go wrong. But here's some very good news. This book is organized in a way so that you can select information. You don't have to read the whole book, so you don't need to read all of the negativities and be worried. Just read what interests you the most. In fact, it also tells you some worry wart advice and wives tales that you should not listen to (Such as how well you're ""carrying"" or fainting ""spells"").Besides, why get several books about pregnancy when you can find all of the information in one book? (I like this book a lot better than that ""Weekly Guide"". Monthly guides are better.) This book tells everything from choosing a practitioner to the steps of labor. You can just look at the sample pages in this store. The pregnancy diet, your monthly check ups, weith gain, twins, intimacy issues, safe exercises, not to mention morning sickness, fatigue, dizziness, blood pressure, you name it and it's here. One thing that I especially love about this book is that it explains how not every pregnancy is the same, so no woman goes through the same feelings or issues. There's even helpful information for fathers. It tells you loads of information about labor and delivery, including caesareans, pain medications, and labor induction. It tells you about postpartum and breastfeeding. Don't listen to what one reviewer said about breastfeeding. The book doesn't say that you're selfish if you don't breastfeed. It says that the reason why breastfeeding is so popular nowadays is that women know breastfeeding is better for themselves and their babies(read that whole section to see what I mean). You might not want to read the section about illness during pregnancy, since it says just about every possible illness anyone can get. But it also says what you should know about using medicine or herbal remedies. There is information that can make you scared, but can also be important to know about, such as ectopic pregnancies, possible risks to premature births, miscarriages, and even pregnancy loss. I think that what shows how caring the authors of the book really are is the section about coping with the unlikely event of death to the born child. Even though some of the information is scary, does book does explain that many pregnancy problems are uncommon. It also lists information about childbirth organizations, finding a doula, and finding different types of obstricians.I highly recommend this book whether you are an expecting mother or a student in the field, like me. Read it while enrolled in a childbirth class. Read a lot, but be selctive.",,

I read a few pregnancy books, and this one was BY FAR the most helpful and thorough book out there. It's got the answer to every single question I could have asked myself. The morning I went in to labor, I grabbed the book and started reading about false labor and contractions to see if I was really in labor or not.The book is broken down in to sections by each month of pregnancy. The author describes what is going on with the baby during each month, what kind of symptoms you may/may not be having, and gives a list of what to expect at your doctor's appointment that month. Everything was pretty accurate and helped me to understand what changes my body was going through. It was also neat to read about what my baby looked like and how she was developing as each month passed.Also in each section is a ""frequently asked questions"" type of format that had every single question and answer I could possibly think of - and tons I would never have thought of. Any time I had a question, I broke out this book and was able to find the answer. And every time I asked my doctor a question, he gave me an answer almost exactly the same as the book.I highly recommend this book to any pregnant woman, especially first-timers like myself This book helped me through a lot of anxiety and worry about my baby.

There are so many seemingly innocent, but really snide and insulting comments about weight and diet. Their emphasis on the Best Odds Diet is absurd and the Diet isn't that great either. It seems very old fashioned. Also in general the authors don't seem to have much scientific backing for many of their statements about all topics. Also, their know-it-all condescending tone is really a turn off after a few chapters. I actually refer to the authors as ""those skinny b*****s and the book as ""the skinny b*****s' book""I think What to Expect the First Year is even worst.

There is no question about that. Anyone investigating 19th century Western literature or who has a keen interest in disturbing fiction should read this novel. Indeed, Freudian, Darwinist, Niethzean, and Socialist forces were changing the West in the 1800's, and Stoker effectively uses them to frighten the reader. However, Amazon.Com wasn't convenient in the 19th century; it wasn't around. Similarly, what scared middle class Britons in the 19th century just isn't disturbing any longer.

0816156921,Dracula (G. K. Hall (Large Print)),,,,13/18,3.0,1050883200,"""Unclean!""","*Dracula* is now considered a masterpiece (with even such an august authority like Harold Bloom including it in his *Western Canon*). This is a recent development. The drive for canonization began about 20 years ago, after a generation of poorly educated academics, hypnotized by the need to politicize all literature, began talking about the book's ""subversive themes"" within its Victorian context. Before this, the novel was (rightly) dismissed as nothing more than a popular horror novel with some fun ... undertones. Influential, yes; but a classic of literature . . .? Alas, time marches on, and it now seems that Bram Stoker has become the Douglas Sirk of the Victorian literati. We are now told that Dracula is gay because his creator was gay. (After all, Dracula is a ""Count"", you know. Campy!) We are informed that the novel has a lot to say about how proper little Anglicans viewed swarthy Easterners. The Science vs. Religion debate gets a lot of ink. Freudian critics ecstatically write essays about the work, for obvious reasons.The critics may be substantially correct. However, none of their intellectualizing will help the modern reader as he plows his way through this Ladies' Gothic Romance. Stoker deliberately employs an antiquated style that would have suited the 1830's rather than 1897, when the book was published. Oh, the characters are all very ""modern""; the women know how to use typewriters; the headshrinkers record their skepticisms on phonographic diaries; but they also say things like this: ""Unclean! Unclean! Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh! I must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgement Day"" (Chapter 22). The dialogue is peppered with stuff like: ""Oh, dear, dear Jonathan"", ""My dear, sweet little girl"", ""What fools we women are!"", etc. It's all rather embarrassing to read . . . darling. Didn't Stoker learn anything about prose style from his buddy Oscar Wilde? How could any self-respecting author write like this after the advent of Hardy and Henry James?To be fair, let it be said that the first four chapters of the novel are among the best ever written in this genre. These early chapters are so strong, in fact, that the rest of the book is one long anti-climax. Jonathan Harker's journal is a compactly-written piece of terror that describes his spooky journey to Castle Dracula and his eventual imprisonment there by his lugubrious host. Even here, there's much to laugh at, such as Harker's snobbish anecdotes about the quaint ""locals"" of the Romanian countryside, his full cataloging of his meals ("". . . I fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken"", and so on), and the comical spectacle of Dracula cooking and later removing the table-service for his guest on a daily basis -- even after they have ""caught on"" to each other. Something about the early chapters has always fascinated me: Harker figures out within a fortnight that the Count is a vampire. The Count KNOWS that Harker is aware of his (the Count's) true nature. And yet they go on being civil to one another for at least two months afterwards! I wonder how they spent their evenings. The Count must have continued to cook for and feed his guest, who otherwise would've starved to death. What did they talk about? Stoker refuses to go into it -- the diary simply jumps weeks ahead.There are excellent moments later in the book. Two remarkable monologues: the blasphemous diatribe on the hypocrisy of gravestones by Old Man Swales, and Van Helsing's great paean to hysteria, otherwise known as the ""King Laugh"" speech. The saga of the doomed ship ""Demeter"" is almost as worthy as the first four chapters. Dracula, as wolf, bursting through Lucy's bedroom window -- with the servants drugged downstairs -- is a genuinely terrifying scene.Characters? Harker, Seward, Van Helsing, and Mina make the strongest impressions, except for Renfield, of course, the most interesting personage by far in the tale. And what of Dracula? He turns out to be a rather dim bulb. He apparently leaves the safe demesnes of his beloved Carpathians because he feels he's missing out on some sort of ""action"" or other. He's so eager to take a powder, in fact, that he forgets to make sure that Harker is safely dead (or Undead, as the case might be) before he books passage aboard the ""Demeter"". It never occurs to the vampire that the Englishman might make his way back home with a whopper of a tale to tell about funny-accented Romanians who climb up and down castle walls like Spider-Man. Further, the dopey Count recklessly goes after the same victims over and over once landed in England, thereby ensuring that a group of outraged Anglicans will pursue him to the ends of the earth. Oh well, Van Helsing DOES say that Dracula isn't very smart; but what does that say about Stoker's plotting? As far as the Count's appearance goes, the author apparently based the description on his own boss, the actor Sir Henry Irving.Ultimately, the novel's hero is Mina, by default. She represents the emerging power of the ""New Woman"" (her phrase). Every character, including the vampire, gets seduced by her eventually. Stoker makes a point of having Mina ""win over"" her poor dead friend Lucy's three suitors (AFTER she's married to Harker, no less) in a scene that subversively mocks Lucy's ... triumphs (which were pretty subversive already). Later, she adds the Dutch quack and the vampire to her collection of conquered males. Meanwhile, her husband Harker lies in the hymeneal marriage bed literally paralyzed, with gray hair, while she gets it on with Dracula. This priceless moment produces Stoker's best line, e.g., that bit about the Count forcing her face to his chest as if he were pushing a kitten's head into a saucer of milk.

Bram Stoker does not romanticize the vampire, which may not sit well with younger readers. This story does not make a person long for the wretched existence that his undead creations experience. His vampires neither ""sparkle"" nor burn in the sunlight, but they are stronger at night. DRACULA does not fall in love with his victims. He is not wanting to reunite with the reincarnated soul of his long dead wife. He is only seeking to expand his ""territory"" as he did in life. DRACULA practiced necromancy in his human life in an attempt to extend life beyond the death of his human body, and succeeded, but as a changed being. He infects his prey, and a dead victim becomes a lovely killing machine - a predator, devoid of humanity. These Fledgling vampire creations lose most of their personality, along with their empathy, and their immortal soul.

Taking place on the barren desert planet, Arrakis, otherwise known as simply Dune to the native Fremen, Paul Maud'dib Atreides has ruled his galactic throne with a religious jihad, ordaining himself as the God Emperor of the Galaxy. But how can a man of flesh, though thought to be messiah of the Fremen, claim to be God? This ruler who's body is not strong enough to repel the radiation of an atomic blast succumbs to physical blindness. Planets across his domain beg for a constitution against the emperor's despotic reign. And all Paul Maud'dib really wants is to secure the safety of his concubine Chani and their twin heirs. But the emperors prophetic visions will not allow for the survival of both.What is phenomenal about this tragedy is the inner struggle of an icon of worship. Even messiahs are only humans. Paul Maud'dib will have to unravel a conspiracy between the shipping guild, the face dancers, the school of witches, and his own wife princess. Marriage being political to secure the imperial throne from the last emperor. Paul Maud'dib will have to do all this and sacrifice one love over another before he too gives up his life for the desert as a true Fremen. The blind are a waist of water.

I would generally rate Frank Herbert's Dune as one of the greatest sci fi books of all time (5 stars), but the audiobook version lacks something in its portayal. The reading switches between a single person and a cast, the main difference being that some chapters have the one reader doing the voices of the book's characters and then the voices are being done by a distinctly different series of individuals. Most of the time this makes little difference, but there are enough instances where the portayal of a character is so different between the cast's rendering and the single reader's that it becomes very distracting. For example, Count Fenring is a totally different character while being read by the one reader than when he has his own cast member doing the voice. This was enough to pull me out of the story and cause me to reflect on why the flip back and forth between the styles of audiobook reading.

1556909330,Dune,,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""",1/2,5.0,1193184000,A Remarkable Work; A Great Classic,"Written over a period of six years, DUNE first appeared in the pages of ANALOG magazine and was thereafter rejected by one publisher after another until a tiny publishing house named Chilton took it on in 1965. It received considerable critical praise and numerous awards, but it was no more than a marginal commercial success until the early 1970s, when it at last began to reach an audience beyond the core of science-fiction fans who so praised it--and in fact its designation as a ""science-fiction masterpiece"" prevented me from reading the book from well over a decade, for science-fiction is not a genre I particularly enjoy.But I will make an exception for DUNE. This may seem an odd comparison, but in a certain sense it is somewhat like GONE WITH THE WIND: it is long, it is flawed, and it is occasionally silly in a stylistic sense--but you just can't stop reading the damn thing. To pick up DUNE is to find yourself locked in its pages until exhaustion claims you, and on the three occasions I have read the book I have done so over the course of a single day. Such is the power of Herbert's vision and narrative that nothing else matters.An outline of the plot reads like ""space opera"" of the least inspired variety: an ecologically hostile planet becomes the center of galactic intrigue due to the fact that is the only known source of a substance--in this instance described as a ""spice."" But what Hebert does with the idea is completely unexpected. DUNE is not a tedious rehash of Edgar Rice Burroughs; it is an astonishing portrait of an unexpectedly plausible civilization in which politics, religion, and corruption begin to spin wildy out of control.Perhaps the single most astonishing thing about DUNE is that there really isn't much in the way of ""science"" in this science-fiction. Not only is this a universe in which computers are forbidden, they are plausibly forbidden--and while Herbert is adept at inventing (and, perhaps even more difficult, convincingly naming) futuristic equipment, he doesn't actually spend a tremendous amount on it. The items simply exist in much the same way as you or I might regard a cup and saucer. It is a turn of mind that makes these devices remarkable plausible.Moreover, it has the effect of focusing the story on the characters, the civilization, and the planet itself. And it is here that Herbert really knocks the ball out the park: Duke Leto, Lady Jessica, Paul, Chani--every character is remarkably well rendered, their backgrounds and struggles and ambitions equally so, and the ecology of the planet an overriding concern as the struggle to survive in what is easily one of the most hostile enviroments ever to spring forth from a writer's mind.Herbert wrote several more DUNE novels before his death and his son has continued the series. I have sampled a few, and while I'm sure many will disagree, I have to say that they should have left well enough alone; there is only one DUNE, and this is it. And if you have seen the truly dire film version--don't let that stop you from picking up the book.

It inspired me to attempt an imitiation, a post-apocalyptic world full of made-up terms and objects. I finished the glossary, but only managed to write the first chapter.Rereading ""Dune"" many years later, I realized that Herbert must have done the same thing. It seemed that he lavished most of his attention and affection for the book's world on the glossary. The actual text gave me the impression that he was looking for excuses to insert all of the great stuff he had thought of (""Inkvine - OK, I need a character who was whipped with inkvine and has a scar from it, OK, got that, now moving right along""). This made the world seem clumsy and contrived. Lord of the Rings, and even Harry Potter contain innumerable examples of items unique to those worlds, but they are presented as part of the milieu, flowing naturally out of the events in those stories. Also, no glossary is required in either of those series - the author gives a brief explanation of the new term, without stopping the action, then seamlessly integrates it into the story, showing us how it functions in that world.If Herbert had only wanted to write a glossary, he could have done so, and left it at that, like Milorad Pavic's ""Dictionary of the Khazars,"" but that would have made Dune a postmodern work, not science fiction, i.e.:""Contemporaries say that Mustaj-Beg Sabljak could not keep food down and that, like a turtledove, he ate and excreted simultaneously. On his military campaigns he took along wet nurses to breast-feed him. But he did not mix with women, or with people in general; he could lie only with the dying, so they brought to his tent dying women, men, and children, who had been purchased, bathed, and dressed for this purpose. Only with them could he spend the night, as though he was afraid of impregnating anyone who might live.

The story is simple, at the heart being the struggle to destroy a ring forged by a powerful evil that in the hands of it's maker would spell doom for everyone.I know some people felt it slow moving, and I don't totally disagree, but I loved it all the same.

It is amazing how much seems new to me after all these years.The beginning of the trilogy, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings,&quot; is an enticing feast to begin with. It picks up years after the ending of Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit.&quot; The story begins with the coming again of Gandalf to, and the departure of Bilbo from the Shire. It then moves forward into telling about Bilbo's nephew Frodo and the magic ring Bilbo leaves him.As events are set in motion, Frodo flees his peaceful home in the Shire. He and a fellowship of others are commissioned with destroying the magical ring...which they are informed is the most powerful tool of evil ever created...the One Ring. The great problem they face is trying to figure out how they will march straight into the heart of the enemy's power to the only place it can be destroyed.I am amazed at the eloquent power of Tolkien's writing. As a child, I was only concerned by the action of the plot (and there is plenty of action and suspense here). Now that I am a little bit older, I am blown away by the depth of these books. Tolkien's creation--the world of Middle Earth is a masterpiece. These stories are filled with poetry and legends from the past ages of middle earth. This depth makes the tale of the Ring breathe with life and wonder.The characters are even more fascinating than the journeys they go on.

They don't have much magic about them, and they aren't nearly as formidable as Dwarves. They do, however, possess extraordinary grit and endurance. These qualities stand Frodo Baggins in good stead as he sets off to dispose of a magic ring left to him by his Uncle Bilbo. Disposing of such a trinket may seem a small matter, but the very fate of Middle Earth depends upon the outcome of Frodo's errand.Frodo exits his homeland pursued by Furies: Nine undead kings mounted upon great black stallions. These Dark Riders have supernatural power and homicidal intent: they will find and destroy Frodo and restore the ring to its &quot;rightful&quot; owner, Sauron the Dark Lord.Along the way, Frodo acquires a motley crew of helpers: Legolas, a woodland Elf who is a dead shot with a bow; Gimli, a brawny Dwarf whose axe can cleave Goblins with the best of them; Pippin, Merry, and Samwise, fellow Hobbits who are great friends and admirers of Frodo; Aragorn, son of Arathorn, a mysterious woodsman; Boromir of Gondor, the very incarnation of the knight errant; and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard who knows better than any other member of the company the importance of their mission.The company meets exotic friends, confronts implacable foes, and surmounts daunting obstacles to move Frodo closer to accomplishing his important mission.

Tolkien's novel titled, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; is the first book of the, &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; trilogy. The trilogy picks up where Tolkien's novel, &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; left off. Tolkein has a great imagination that is evident in his writing. He creates the fictional land called Middle Earth. The land is filled with dwarves, elves, humans, and hobbits. Hobbits are hairy creatures about half the size of humans. Hobbits enjoy simple lives but are capable of great feats and courage if they are pushed to it. &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; tells the story of some extraordinary hobbits.Frodo is hobbit that lives in Hobbiton. Gandalf, an important and powerful wizard, gives Frodo the responsibility of caring for a special ring. The ring makes the wearer invisible, but it seems to have an evil affect on people. After many years, Gandalf discovers the true power of the ring. Gandalf tells Frodo that the ring is called the, &quot;One Ring.&quot; The ring was created long ago and holds much power. Gandalf has also learned of an evil force trying to retrieve the ring. Sauron, the Dark Lord, is searching for the ring. If Sauron reaches the ring, he will control the Middle Earth. Gandalf tells Frodo that the the ring must be destroyed, and it can only be destroyed at the Mountain of Fire. Frodo decides to make the lengthy journey along with three other hobbit friends to destroy the ring.Along the journey, the hobbits come across many different people and dangers. Middle Earth is filled with many different types of creatures. Some are good, and some are evil. It is clear that Tolkien spent much time thinking about the land called Middle Earth. The characters are well developed and are easy to relate with. It is interesting to read about all the cities, creatures, and people in Middle Land. I am a slow reader, and I usually get aggrivated with books over 400 pages. However, I really enjoyed this book, and I plan to finish the trilogy when I get the time.",,

Personally I have a very, very strong affection for this book and I think it is truly one of the most beautiful works of literature of all time. Tolkien's landscape of imagination is staggering. I understand that some people may find the songs and poems tedious to read, but I think it is these songs and poems which bring a certain magic to the whole story. This story is amazing - it is comical, adventurous and dark at the same time. I actually felt sad when it came to an end! Tolkien had this incredible talent for evoking strong emotions from the reader (well, from me anyway!); his style is simple, yet elegant and beautiful, and melancholy all at once. I thought that many of the characters were given great depth, and I became especially fond of Gandalf and Sam! And one of the things I really loved about this story was that the 'hero' who embarked on the quest to destroy the Ring, and who suffered greatly from this quest, was actually a little hobbit and not some stereotyped handsome hero. This goes to show that everyone - including little plain people - can be a hero in their own way, if they have the heart to accomplish their task.I have read other fantasy stories, but somehow I just don't find them even remotely as captivating as Tolkien's LOTR.Reading this book opened up a whole new world to me, and it was indeed a wonderful, unforgettable experience. I read this book in high school, and I've been reading it at least once every year since. I never tire of it, it is very endearing.

It was my second time and I think it is my favorite part of the Lord of the Rings (LOTR). Some of my favorite incidents happen here from, &quot;An Unexpected Party,&quot; where many a Hobbit gather for Bilbo's farewell party to, &quot;At the Sign of The Prancing Pony,&quot; a visit to a busy inn in the Hobbit town of Bree. Also, the chapters, ""Many Meetings,"" and, ""The Council of Elrond,"" are rare times of joy and rest where many different races meet for the Council of Elrond. Then, of course, there are the climatic chapters, ""A Journey in the Dark,"" and, ""The Bridge of Kazad-dum."" and, ""The Breaking of the Fellowship.""What I like about the novel is this is where one learns the background of the tale; where did the Ring come from, what does it do and where has it been all these centuries? Tolkien creates a feeling that FOTR stands in a long tradition; the world of the novel is already thousands of years old by the time we visit it. After one finishes the entirety of the Lord of the Rings, ""The Silmarillion,"" provides the creation myth and the ancient history of the Elves and the other races of Middle-Earth; Tolkien worked on it his whole life.There is also a great feeling of ambience; from the way Tolkien describes geography to the description of buildings and the physical description of characters. On a deeper level, one has the feeling that the current age is about to set and another age is about to rise. The mysterious, powerful, joyous Elves of old are about to fade away and leave Middle-Earth (where Tolkien set his story) forever and Men will takeover and so begin the Fourth Age.The story is suspenseful, as the small company of Hobbits sets out from their sheltered homeland called the Shire to far off Rivendell, just west of the Misty Mountains. All along the way, they are followed by the Black Riders who seek to recover the Ring from Frodo (the Hobbit who carries it) and return it to its evil Master. At times, Frodo is tempted to use the power of the Ring even though he knows that it is evil. At Bree, the company meets with Strider; who wears&quot;[a] travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he wore a good that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.&quot;They all journey to Rivendell, where the many tales of old are told and the Council of Elrond is called to decide the fate of the Ring. The decision is made and a Fellowship made to guide Frodo; Merry, Sam, Pippin (his original Hobbit companions), Legolas (an Elf of Mirkwood), Gimli (a Dwarf of the Lonely Mountain), Boromir (Man of Gondor), Strider, and Gandalf the Grey (a wizard) set out with Frodo. They set out to cross the Misty Mountains, but defeated by snow and weather, decide to turn back and enter the Mountain. The Mountain used to be a grand palace of Dwarves and is sung of in their songs.I can only encourage you to read this book before the movie comes out. While the movie does look quite good, novel-film conversion is never perfect and the book is better than the film nearly every time, so read the book first. I set a goal to re-read the entire epic before the films arrive.",,

It's an old book, so the prose is &quot;dated.&quot; It can also be very historical at times, delving into pasts far from the present, and never to be spoken of again.But THAT'S what makes this such an engrossing tale...the histories. Everything from Bilbo's songs to the story of Strider's sword add to each beings personality and give them a life that few modern writers can achieve.And the images Tolkien can conjure span many generations and are as individual as the person reading it. He gives enough information of the Shire and Rivendale and Bree and everywhere else to form an idea, but not so much so that he corners you into seeing what the next person sees. The many interpretations of Frodo himself are testement to this.If you want something to read in two days, grab a Brooks novel, if you want something you can read again and again and get something new from it each time, I highly recommend this.",,

After being incredibly intrigued by&quot;the Hobbit&quot;, I can honestly say this book disappointed me. A precaution though: I loved &quot;the Two Towers&quot; and &quot;the Return of the King&quot;, but &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; is the worst book in the series.To begin with, lots of stuff we learn in the beginning seems irrelevent. I confess, I eventually gave up on the seemingly inconsequential prologue and skipped right to chapter 1. While this problem doesn't taint the rest of the book too much, the prologue is just too long and showcases this flaw too much to just ignore.Even once the story begins, you still have to deal with the slow pace that I'm sure you've read about in the negative reviews. Tolkien just takes too much time describing things. Basically, the problem runs through almost the whole book, but especially in the early going. I realize some description is needed, but &quot;the Hobbit&quot; was just as descriptive, yet had far less space devoted to descriptions.But there's good stuff as well, Namely the charactor interactions. Scenes like Gandalf revealing the truth about the Ring to Frodo and Frodo's chat with Gimli's father Gloin really redeem this book.But that doesn't change the fact that this is the worst of the trilogy. I'd give it 31/2 stars, rounded down. It is true &quot;the Fellowship of the Ring&quot; will be remembered as the book that started the original fantasy series, but being there first only holds so much credibility.

The Lord of the Rings is one of the best books ever written&quot;. And it is. But this is not a review of the book, it is a review of Rob Inglis' READING of the book. And the editorial raves not withstanding, I am sorry to say that this is not a reader that EVERYONE will like. Before I get lynched, here's why I think so.I have listened to HUNDREDS of audio books. All unabridged. Inglis falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. He has a deep voice -- this would not normally be an issue were he reading a historical work. But Inglis is one of those readers who does &quot;voices&quot;. NOw some people are genius at this. For example, the incomparable Frederick Davidson. But for Inglis, the deep voice is a liability when he tries to pitch it high to do an elf voice or, good heavens, a woman's voice. The result is very annoying.Also, fans of the Trilogy will know that it is filled with song. Inglis' rendering of the songs was grating (at times almost embarassing) -- and got my fast forward finger working over-time. He is over-matched by this, particularly when it comes to Galadriel or Legolas.Next there is the manner, or tone, in which Inglis has chosen to pitch his reading. He has adopted a wistful, elegiac, far away manner -- it is almost pretentious, I have to say. And it becomes tedious because he almost never varies it. He is, as the saying goes, &quot;a bit one paced&quot;. Now, some people will like his voice and manner, I do not deny this -- because it does, as one of the editorial reviews says, emphasize the fairy tale aspect of the Trilogy.But to me is drains some of the manliness and power from some of the dialogue. Aragorn, to me the quintessential man of action and mystery, a true hero, comes across as a man obessesed with what has been lost; a man trapped in the past. Which he clearly isn't.Some examples. Aragorn and Boromir are virtually indistinguishable. The Hobbits (apart from Frodo), Sam in particular, are rendered in a country bumpkin voice that is out of all keeping with what I see as the inherent dignity of the Hobbits. It also serves to underscore Sam as the servant of Frodo, rather than his friend. Legolas ends up with a reedy, strained voice, because Inglis can not get into the higher register. I was left thinking, &quot;who ever made the rule that Elves had little high voices?&quot;HAVING SAID ALL THAT, this is the ONLY unabridged version. And as such, falls into the &quot;must have&quot; category. For all of the foregoing quibbles, Inglis' reading is serviceable and entertaining. Buy it -- you will enjoy it -- but do not expect the definitive reading -- that awaits us! Which is an ocassion for celebration I suppose. Because surely it will come.",,

Tolkien was the master of fantasy, and that's not just because he was the first to write a very popular modern epic.What makes Tolkien superior was how he used his extensive knowledge of mythology and linguistics to create his own complex world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College where he studied and taught the linguistics of early English. Over many years he created his own elvish language with a complex syntax and grammar, and a complete history and mythology of Middle Earth (see the twelve volumes of The Histories of Middle-Earth below.) This gives his works so much complexity and texture that when you read them, you feel like you've dropped into the middle of a real civilization.Besides the amazing world-building, Tolkien builds excellent characters and uses them to explore such heavy human themes as friendship, love, greed, power, redemption, gender-roles, self-sacrifice, and death. This is not a light epic for a Sunday afternoon. This is intense, bone-chilling, goose-bump raising stuff. You can feel the weight of the world on the shoulders of Frodo and his companions. And, though there's a happy ending, it comes with much suffering and loss.And all the while, Tolkien's writing is beautiful and poignant. In my opinion, the only writers I've read who even begin to compare are Ursula LeGuin, Susanna Clarke, and perhaps Lois McMaster Bujold.~FantasyLiterature.net",,

I don't know how many times I've read it since then, but a conservative guess would be at least a dozen times. I just finished reading it again last weekend - it was once again, outstanding!So, what should you know if you are pondering your first foray into Tolkien's tale of Middle Earth? Lets see...1) ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" done not include a complete stand-alone tale. It is, rather, the first book of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy which also includes the volumes ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". So, when you get to the end of this volume you are left hanging there...you MUST get the other two books to complete the tale. (That's what happened to me when I read this book the first time [as an assignment for a college English class I was taking])2) This is a classic tale of good versus evil, but, as you can read in the forward, Tolkien states that it is not meant to be an allegory; it is just a tale that he wanted to tell.3) Be prepared to have your traditional views of what an elf, wizard, etc., are to be challenged.4) This book can be enjoyed by readers of many ages. I read it first when I was in college, and, later, when I had children of my own I read this trilogy to them while they were in elementary school (one was even a pre-schooler - that was years before the movies of the same names were released).5) There is no objectionable language in the books, though many parts convey a dark image of a world under the sway or impending threat of evil.6) You do not have to read Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" before reading this book. And I found this trilogy to be far superior to ""The Hobbit"" when I did read it.At first I wondered at the Amazon-indicated reading level of 9-12 yrs for this book. I would not have guessed that when I first read it, but now that I have children of my own that have consumed the entire ""Harry Potter"" series as well as many other long novels, I can see how a 9-12 yr range could work for these books as well...depending on the child. Be aware though, that there are many places in the book where Tolkien's characters launch into sometimes extensive recitation of verse as part of the story. That can put off some younger readers (I sometimes skip over those parts myself...though that may offend some Tolkien purists out there)If you have children that like books like ""Harry Potter"", ""Eragon"", etc., and they are looking for a new adventure, you might suggest this one to them. I have read the ""Harry Potter"" books, and if I were to compare them to Tolkien's works I have to say that Tolkien's story conveys a richer image of a world to me than do the books of JK Rowling (though I also enjoyed them).All in all, this book launches a top-flight story and represents what I consider to be the prototypical modern fantasy story - ""The Lord of the Rings.""Definitely 5 stars (only because I can't award more)",,

The audio CD version of this makes the book very digestible, and the reader (Shakespearean actor Rob Inglis) is excellent.In re-reading this first volume 35 years later, I am struck by the vulnerability of good and the primacy of evil in Tolkien's universe. It is no accident that the standard bearers for good are brave little hobbits; good is a distinct underdog in this world.The triumph of good against all odds is our most basic human myth, and Tolkien tells this oldest of stories in a fresh and entertaining fashion.

There's food, dancing, poetry, storytelling, magic, tragedy, adventure, suspense and humor.

Perhaps it was inevitable. The glitterari and trendsetters could not resist a book written about *them*. But it begs the question, &quot;Why will people read this book in the year 2005?&quot;To me, the value of The Tipping Point is that the book starts to define an operative set of handles. Wheelbarrows are valuable tools because they balance the load over the wheel and they have a set of handles that allow the operator to control the how-and-when of tipping.The early chapters of the book are a prelude, the backdrop, for the chapter on Crime in New York City and the chapter on Teen Smoking and Suicide. Those two chapters are the reason I gave it to a member of the local school board. We thought we knew something about how to control violence in schools. We were wrong.The Tipping Point makes a compelling argument *against* the triage approach. Paraphrasing the book's arguments: People are sheep. People look to the external environment for cues regarding appropriate behavior. Triage, on the part of the authorities, let's the little stuff go and tries to grapple with the big stuff. People are sophisticated enough to look at the stress points in the social fabric for their cues. Have the authorities &quot;written off&quot; the subways, the bathrooms, the shadows behind the bleachers? Why should a would-be criminal fear the authorities if they are not competent enough to keep the toilets working?The Tipping Point states that you have to find the stress points that people look to for behavior cues. Then you commit the resources required to make those stress points clean and safe.Managing the heck out of the stress points was one of the handles documented in The Tipping Point. The Tipping Point described several other sets of handles. Consider buying the book if you ever need to manage the behavior of others.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

He uses many references and tells many stories that are informative and amusing for a young person with little scope of the big world, or someone who wants to kill time.The idea of this book is not new at all. It is merely a rehash of what is widely known in dealing with issues related to herd manipulation, be that disease epidemics or marketing. The so many stories in the book confound its theme and undermine the author's ability to communicate clear and convincing ideas.For example, he claims that by understanding the rules of epidemics, we could manipulate their outcome and mentions issues like teenage smoking, movies, etc. Yet, his stories seem to show his desire for flexing his wide knowledge in every field in life. He talks about syphilis, AIDS, TV show, research, while blurring the main highlights of the book.In Chapter 1, ""The three rules of epidemics"", he twists the concept of ""vector"" into his fancy rule of ""The law of the few"", twists the concept of ""host resistance"" to his fancy ""Stickiness factor"", twists the concept of ""host to vector interaction"" to his fancy ""The power of context"". Then he builds the entire book, with so many references on such twisted inventions.In chapter 2, ""The law of the few"", he merely stretches the causative vector in any epidemics into connectors, informed mediators, and salesmen and demonstrates each in many stories.Chapter 3, ""The stickiness factor"", explains the impact of the vector on the host through case studies on Sesame Street, Blue's clues show, and education virus.Chapters 4 and 5, ""The power of context"", are full with stories such as the fall in New York City crime rate and Sesame Street to demonstrate the importance of the environment, where the vector and host interact, on the outcome of epidemics.Chapters 6 and 7, ""case study"", many more stories to explain the already told many stories.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

Bukowsky ""booklover10""",13/14,5.0,1110672000,Rethinking the obvious.,"Common sense dictates that to succeed in marketing a product widely, a company should buy advertising in high profile media outlets during prime time. In addition, to combat teen smoking, parents should shun cigarettes themselves (to set a good example for their kids), and public health officials should launch powerful anti-smoking campaigns in schools and on television. Malcolm Gladwell, in his smash bestseller ""The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,"" challenges these and other conventional ideas.The author makes the case that epidemics of viruses, ideas, and behavior do not always originate or spread in obvious ways. Only by studying the manner in which epidemics really work can we hope to either make them more widespread or stop them in their tracks. The author introduces a whole new vocabulary in this bible of counter-intuitive thinking. For instance, the aforementioned ""tipping point"" is the ""dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything can change all at once."" To explain the mechanics of epidemics, Gladwell also introduces such phrases as ""The Law of the Few,"" ""The Stickiness Factor,"" and ""The Power of Context."" In chapters that deal with such topics as suicide, children's television, fashion, and AIDS, Gladwell cites studies that show, again and again, that common sense is often wrong. We have to think out of the box to understand how contagion works in the real world.Why read this book at all? Does the average person care about how epidemics start, spread, or stop? One reason to pick up ""The Tipping Point"" is that it is enormously entertaining. Gladwell imparts his lively ideas clearly and with the skill of a seasoned storyteller. His conclusions are intriguing and thought-provoking; this book has the potential to change how we view the people and events in our own lives.

Davidson,13/14,3.0,1112745600,Positive & Negative,"I am seriously ambivalent about this book, simultaneously being very negative and quite positive...First, the negative, deeply cynical comments...Golly gosh some things are non-linear! Maybe the spread of ideas is non-linear! Perhaps the techniques used by people studying other non-linear phenomena, particularly those used by epidemiologists, could be applied.Gladwell takes these hardly earth shattering observations and coins some buzzwords to describe the key concepts. The buzzwords appear to have been devised by a marketing man, containing strong, powerful words: Tipping POINT, the LAW of the few, Stickiness, POWER of context. He then builds a meandering, long-winded book about it, beating each concept to death with fluffy prose and padding the whole thing with interminable anecdotes.On a more positive note...I actually rather enjoyed this book, particularly the anecdotes. I stand by the substance of the negative comments above but unless that sort of thing really, really winds you up it should not overwhelm the book's positive qualities. He is hopelessly long winded (after all, he does write for the New Yorker which never uses a word when multiple paragraphs will do) but he writes well and there are some good stories.The section on the law of the few makes some interesting points - he introduces the concepts of Mavens (people who know things), Salesmen (people who can convince people) and Connectors (people who know lots of people) and illustrates how and why they are responsible for the spread of ideas. He makes the point (repeatedly) that these people are the important factors in spreading ideas - it is the law of the few because it requires remarkably few of them. There are some good anecdotes - the resurgence of hush puppies, Airwalk trainers, Paul Revere raising the alarm that the British were coming (he does stretch the Paul Revere story to breaking point - he knew the right people, he other guy didn't).The chapter on stickiness includes an interesting, if overlong, description of how Sesame Street and Blues Clues try to ensure that children remember their message (literacy). It is a little disappointing that the pursuit of stickiness has led us from a wonderful program (Sesame Street) full of wit and invention to the anodyne and dull Blue's Clues. In this case, I guess that the (good) end does justify the means; interestingly Gladwell steered clear of examples where the end is less patently good.The chapters on context and the case studies are the most interesting. He does a particularly good job in demonstrating how very small changes in environment (context) can have a profound impact. He provides the best and most convincing explanation I have read of why New York's 'no broken windows' zero tolerance policing approach worked. The case studies of smoking (smoking isn't cool, smokers, or rather people with a strong disposition to smoke, are), Micronesian suicides and the law of 150 are very interesting.Overall, it is worth reading (providing you are not too cynical or too familiar with the subject areas that he draws on) and it does provide a number of good conversation topics - I just wish that either he was more familiar with Occam or had a better editor.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

Like the old adage goes that begins ""for want of nail a shoe was lost, for want of a shoe a horse was lost"" so goes the idea behind The Tipping Point. Every one knows that story but few meditate on its full implications and that the results can be positive as well as the negative. The tipping point strongly presents how one minor event can cascade into chaos, revolution, mass movements, trends in style and innovation. There was in the sixties a catch phrase within the counterculture that ""a single match can cause a brush fire"" and Gladwell offers a great beginning to the exploring the mechanics of how one minor event can cause a brush fire of changes.Describing how ideas can work like a virus (the application of this idea to language is certainly not a new) the thesis has implications to all fieldsand in my mind offers a caution to slackers as well as an inspiration to genius. The Tipping Point shows not only how minor actions can cause this cascade but how entropy can as well.But the book does not stop there as it explains how networks and the quality of those networks contribute to this phenomena.Further the author shows the a sociological and psychological implications and the breeding grounds to change: how certain individuals are more likely to cause the cascade as well how certain groups, societies and countries are more vulnerable to this phenomena. Gladwell being a writer for The New Yorker comes from one such organization where in this country the publication is a powerful engine for change. But it is not the quantity of newsprint that causes this phenomena (as to continue the example other publications have greater circulation) it is rather the people and networks that the publication touches.The three main points or keys to his thesis on the way this phenomena works are: the stickiness factor, the law of the few, and power of context. From my perspective these points is just a beginning (but a very good beginning) that I hope will be explored further by other authors.After reading this book one comes away with a new realization how certain things become trends, how a rumor can run rampant on the Internet and how conspiracy theories can sometimes dominate a rational world.I find it an intersting companion to another best seller ""The World is Flat"".It is a book that offers key insights that offer both hope as well as a word of caution. I find the book particularly timely. I hope that this book itself will become itself a ""tipping point"" and I will endeavor to keep some its ideas in the forefront of my mind.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

""Why do some fashions become a craze while others fail ?"". ""After a while new fashions take over and this happens again and again"". I could not think of a better source that this book to explain her this universal phenomenon.A new product, a management concept, a new book, a movie or simply a restaurant next door can suddenly become a great success with little advertising. We also see that some great products fail to take off despite the best marketing efforts.Malcolm Gladwell takes the analogy of epidemics to explain the concept of the tipping point. The three factors - The Law of the Few, The Stickiness Factor and The power of Context are explained in detail with excellent case studies.Business success is based on acceptance of ideas, products and services by customers globally. Internal acceptance of company strategies and goals is also a vital factor.

Robbins ""Lindsay""",13/14,5.0,1139270400,Tip the World,"This is a book, by Malcom Gladwell, is about a great moment, a moment in time when a behavior, a trend, a thought, or an idea hits that point where it dies or it ""tips"" and spreads amazingly. This is a book that proves the idea that one person can make a difference, a difference that has the ability to affect not only his or her city, state, or country, but a difference that will affect the world. It also indicates that with one mistake, the world could ""tip"" and be a horribly different place. This author proves through many examples and extensive research that one person can make a fashion trend spread, one specific event can drop crime rates, and one person can cause any given product to become popular.This book will make you change the way you think and the way you look at the world. The Author takes time to organize the idea of a ""Tipping Point"" into ""The Three Rules of Epidemics,"" one being contagiousness or stickiness, two being the idea that little causes have big effects, and three being an idea that change is not gradual, but in fact happens at one dramatic moment. He also introduces us to ""The Law of the Few"" which discusses three main people in this world, connectors or people that are masters of ""the weak tie"", mavens or one who accumulates knowledge, and salesmen or people with the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are hearing (I believe the author is one of these people) and helps us understand them and their place in the rules of epidemics. He then follows these ideas up with many case studies that prove or disprove these ideas and facts.The Author makes a clear and well backed-up case on the idea of a tipping point. He explains the Three Rules of Epidemics well enough for anyone to understand, and carries these ideas throughout the book to tie it all together well. The Law of the Few or the three different types of people he describes in the book makes for a very interesting idea, something that one may never have thought of before. He makes these people seem like you and me, and explains their personalities so well that you don't question their existence. He ties the idea of these three types of people into the book very well and proves that these people have an effect on the Three Rules of Epidemics and Tipping Points. He is a firm believer that these three people make up the world, and are the ones who create or cause epidemics and tipping points.This book personally was a great read. It was clear and concise and well written. This idea will change people's way of thinking and make people believe that one event can change the world, good or bad. The author proves that he is a great writer from the beginning of the book. He grabs your attention and organized the book well. The ideas are backed up well by facts and so many examples are provided that everyone should be able to find something to relate to.This book also ties in well to our class. It looks at society as a whole and the different roles that we all play in our society or culture. We can all learn from the idea that we fall into different categories of people, and that these categories fall into the role of different actors in the three rules of epidemics. These things combined cause a tipping point, a difference made by you or me, with ones own opinions, ideas, and through our own means. We can all learn from this because it makes you feel like you are indeed a part of society, and your actions, words, and ideas, do affect others and the world itself.I finished the book thinking that the ideas could be enacted by your or me, whether good or bad. This made me both very excited and hopeful, yet at the same time very scared for our world. The author proves that the ideas are not far out of reach through so many real life examples of things ""tipped"" that you are convinced. I personally feel both scared and excited. Excited that I could make a difference in the world, yet scared that just one thing ""tipping"" could also be the very demise of this world. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to anyone trying to think outside of the box and expand their horizons.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

It was a series of assertions with promises to delight and explain, and the explainations and proof never came. Worse, the reader is left believing that these assertions are facts.Malcolm Gladwell begins by describing how several items including the rise and fall of Hush Puppy shoes can be viewed as an epidemic. He goes on to describe the mechanics of the spread of epidemics. Unfortunately, Malcom Gladwell never comes back and does anything to demonstrate that his assertions have any basis in fact.In one example, Mr. Gladwell asserts that there were documented outbreaks of AIDS at the beginning of the 1900s, but that the disease did not ""stick."" So, we are led to believe then that AIDS disappeared, apparently without victims for another 70 years plus.Mr. Gladwell continually asserts that a statistical correlation implies cause and effect. Statistically teenage boys have more accidents than teenage girls. Does that mean that we could prevent accidents by performing sex change operations? You get the point.Some of his assertions are interesting, and they would have made interesting topics around the family dinner table. My objection is that without any level of proof Gladwell's ""Tipping Point"" does not deliver on what it promises. While interesting, the book did not present any testable or conclusive proofs of its premises. As such, it is dismissable.",['Malcolm Gladwell'],['Reference']

The image of someone stretching a magazine article into a book is fairly accurate. I would rate it higher though several inclusions of Political Correctness drop it:Chapter about someone wanting to spread health information benefiting the ""Black community"" is a fine example. When something like this doesn't quite sit right, just reverse the races. Imagine the author fawning over someone wanting to ""reach out"" to the ""White community"" to raise their awareness of cancer and disease. It wouldn't happen. Why? Funny how those who claim to want equality in truth want special rights.He uses ""African American"" and ""White."" Doesn't that seem inconsistent? Either ""African American"" and ""European American"" or it is ""Black"" and ""White."" Pick one.Regarding the HIV epidemic there is careful exclusion of any sort of assignment of blame for the true cause - immoral behavior - while trying to be too clever for himself starting at his navel pondering whether the discovery of HIV as the cause of AIDS was necessary to fight the disease.Another charge of PC propaganda is his off-hand mention of buying ""Spanish books"" for a library to serve ""that underserved community"" or some such nonsense. Seems an underserved community would be Hungarians or Polish or Germans. When was the last time you saw a section in the library for them? The truth is this reveals his pro-invasion/illegal-alien POV. This underserved community is destroying schools and hospitals with their shameless abuse of the system for which they don't pay. Perhaps he will write a second book describing how the importation of Hepatitis, Tuberculosis, and even Malaria thanks to illegal aliens will cause a ""tipping point"" of those diseases in the US. Or how illegal aliens who come from a culture where driving drunk and the age of consent is 12 has resulted in an epidemic of drunk driving and rape of children?

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye.

I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband.

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book.

I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance.

This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century.

This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

1844560333,Pride and Prejudice,,A3F1K6434NMIMC,xlimpx,1/1,4.0,1071532800,Awesome Novel,"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

1844560333,Pride and Prejudice,,A3LJ339ZPPXJ7A,Karina Ponce,1/1,4.0,1071619200,A Classic Love Story,"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

1844560333,Pride and Prejudice,,A22UCM5QF4XG0O,Juan Hernandez,1/1,5.0,1071792000,A Timeless Classic,"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written book. It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel.

The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society.

While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time!

Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read.

Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me.","['Charlotte Brontë', 'Marc Cactus']",['Fiction']

Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life. Bronte handled the English language in a most eloquent fashion, which I enjoyed very much. It is fascinating to see how a language grows and changes over time.

The movie was beautifully done, but did leave out some very important events that were described in the book. Overall it was a bittersweet love story... A tale of burning down walls figuratively and literally; of allowing ones self to accept truth and love regardless of station; and of knowing ones self above all. Though Bronte does get a bit wordy in her writing (I'm more partial to Emily's writing vs. Charlotte) this is a rewarding story of strength of heart and perseverance of the spirit.","['Charlotte Brontë', 'Marc Cactus']",['Fiction']

What a shame that you can't relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, &quot;listening&quot; to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen's world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I'm afraid I can't recommend Mansfield Park very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a sight to behold. The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence Olivier version is far and away the weakest.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

In recent years, I've read most of Jane Austen's other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel's opening line notes: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane. Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter. And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today's reality TV.

While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (""No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting"").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (""Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do"").Despite its mildly stuffy style, ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Winston Smith's resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone.

The book is terrifying to read because the eery science fiction-like society which Orwell describes is not so inconceivable. I lived in Russia a few years ago and was struck by the cold impersonal drabness of everything. In the blank, hollow, empty eyes of many of Russia's elderly I saw how tyranny had literally erased personality. The spark of humanity which puts light in the eyes had been doused, and all that was left was a shell of a human being who was no longer a person, but merely a function with no independent thought. George Orwell's 1984 has existed to a large degree in totalitarian regimes of the past, and its radical egalitarian roots exist in society today. They seem to be an integral part of human nature's dark side.Two things in this book were especially profound for me. First was Orwell's exposition of the social conflicts between the highs, the middles, and the lows, which Winston Smith read about in Goldstein's book. George Orwell understood totalitarianism well enough to see that equality is not socialism's end, but merely the propagandistic means for replacing the highs. Self-serving tyrants inevitably usurp socialism's ideals and use them to become the highs themselves, indulging themselves in privilege at the expense of the rest of society. After reading Goldstein's book, Winston understood the how, and O'Brien explained to him the why when he declared, chillingly, that power was an end in and of itself.The second thing which struck me as profound was Orwell's exposition of Newspeak, the official language of Oceania which robbed people of their ability to think by robbing them of their ability to express thoughts in words. Rudimentary examples of doublethink, crimethink, and the thought police can be seen in various political groups within our society today.This book is brilliant and prophetic, a must read for all those socialist utopians who have forgotten the dark realities of human nature.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

London still exists, but it is now a part of Oceania, governed by an entity called the Party, headed by a sovereign figure known only as Big Brother. The Party's one goal is power -- power over everybody and everything in Oceania. Surveillance is administered constantly; devices called telescreens are placed in people's homes to monitor thoughts and actions and broadcast Party propaganda continuously, with no way for the resident to turn his off or change the channel. Free thinkers are not tolerated, and roving bands of &quot;Thought Police&quot; are sent to sniff out transgressors. The Party is developing an official language called Newspeak, whose goal is to simplify language by eliminating as many extraneous words as possible and reducing vocabulary to a small number of basic words, thus narrowing the scope of thought.But there's always a rebel. The protagonist is a man named Winston Smith who works at the Ministry of Truth as a sort of professional history revisionist. His job is to revise newspaper articles and documents in which Big Brother made predictions or statements that did not agree with the actual outcome of events; in other words, to maintain the public illusion that the Party is infallible and omniscient. Unhappy with his state of being, Winston would like to overthrow the Party but is powerless to do so. Teaming up with his love interest Julia, another Party worker, he colludes with a high-ranking Party official named O'Brien, who reveals himself as a secret member of a society called the Brotherhood who are planning to destroy the Party. O'Brien gives Winston a subversive book explaining the ideals and motivations of the Party: The upper classes (the highest Party members) need to retain their economic status, so it is important to control the minds and bodies of the lower classes, and wars are waged constantly only so that capital will be spent on the production of war machinery instead of being converted into wealth which could be distributed to the lower classes.Winston knows that if he is caught as a dissident, he's dead. The Thought Police are everywhere, and can he trust Julia, O'Brien, and the friendly old shopkeeper Mr. Charrington to be who they say they really are? Predictably, he is apprehended, but the Party's plans involve not killing but reprogramming him, which unfortunately for poor Winston could be a fate worse than death.&quot;1984&quot; is not strictly an anti-communist rant. (For that, see Arthur Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon.&quot;) Rather, it attacks the complacency of all people and nations who would let a small number of idealists have their way and take command over the rest of the population. Semantics aside, Communism and Fascism, as practiced by certain Twentieth Century world powers, are essentially the same thing: the individual loses all his importance for the benefit of the nation, which really means the ruling Party. If democracy requires eternal vigilance, &quot;1984&quot; illustrates the consequences of apathy.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

It is also one of the most mentally exhausting reads. Taking you from logical absurdities to the haziness of dream worlds to metaphysical discussions.Ok, so why am I giving it 5 stars despite all this?Because in doing it the way it is, Orwell has succeeded in transferring to you his absolute HATRED of mental bondage, and of absolute unchecked human authority, and anything and everything that can lead to them. The rate at which the story is advanced towards the darkness and viciousness, the way he never for a moment leaves a prickle of hope in you heart or your mind about the final outcome of the protagonists or the world in which he lives, all reflect in no uncertain terms this hatred. Sometimes you think to yourself reading this ""ok, I get it, why all this darkness""? Then, you realize what he was doing. He is shouting with the top of his lungs to all of us to NEVER EVER let things even approach the conditions of ""Airstrip one"".What I have found most amazing in the novel towards the end is his resolution of a question that kept lingering in the protagonist's mind throughout the story; the ""why?"", why would the ""Party"" or the people in it do that? I have seen few reviewers allude to it. His answer was as simple and unexpected to me as it was to Winston - the protagonist, yet was perfectly inline with the extreme world Orwell built. There is no ""why"", there is no logic to explain it. Power is an end, not a means. In the words of the party members: ""GOD is power"". There is no reason for such attrocities but a sheer animalistic lust for power. Again, he is in a way saying: ""don't ever try to rationalize it to yourself or others"".What sets ""1984"" apart from its famous sibling ""Animal Farm"", which by the way was also very depressing, is that it is not tailored to the history of the Communists. You could see, in a sense, the development of Orwell's thought while writing these two pieces. He started with the first to document one of the worst forms of collectivism that he witnessed, then - seeing at that time no sign of it being defeated or abated - took it to its extreme form. Such a form was sufficiently general to cover all types of mind slavery, to the extent that it can be applicable everywhere. I belive he might have even hinted at that in the part where he recounts the ""history of the world"" that he imagined from the his time to 1984.

Here, in the States, when you here the words ""spin masters"", you can't help but think of the principle of ""doublethink""; in which one can not only muster the ability to consciously think of something and its opposite at the same time, yet somehow be able to believe both of them. You hear the word ""alternate reality"" in which people hear, read, and see the facts yet still are able to fit them into their worldview. A view in which internment is justified, the poor are robbing the rich, dissent is treason, torture is patriotism, failures are successes, and everything you think is true is a lie fabricated by the an enemy called ""the main stream media"".

George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power. Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists. As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels showing the degrading effects such societies had on people. Throughout this book, one can witness the underlying hatred of Orwell and those imprisoned by the system for the totalitarian state and bureaucracy which completely controls their lives and existences. This book in particular shows that rage in the main character of Winston Smith, a mere pawn in a totalitarian society. Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power. Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men, and maintaining a total disregard for the truth. Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda. This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories. However, Orwell's books are also applicable to the West of today, where the constant menace of totalitarian ideology exists._1984_ gives us a whole slew of new terminology to describe the situation as it exists in a totalitarian state in which political correctness is enforced. The book introduces such terms as thought police, thought crime (and thought criminal), doublethink, memory hole, Ingsoc, and Newspeak. Such terms reflect the complete disregard of the totalitarian state for the truth and the active promotion of propaganda within society. They have also largely entered into our culture as expressions to describe the enforcement of political correctness._1984_ focuses on the main character Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who lives in England and works for the Ministry of Truth. As it turns out, the Ministry of Truth ironically is responsible for spreading propaganda, and as all ministries mentioned by Orwell has a purpose exactly opposite to its stated purpose. The world of 1984 is a very bleak one indeed, run by a single party and its ruling leader ""Big Brother"", in which all individuals are subject to surveillance by the state should they commit a ""thought crime"". All expressions of individuality in 1984 have been wiped out and the human being is totally degraded living a pathetic existence of total subservience to the party. Sexuality has been suppressed as part of the ""Anti-sex League"" as well as religion. Truth itself is highly malleable and memory is constantly distorted, reflected in such ironical and oxymoronic sayings of the party as ""War Is Peace"", ""Freedom Is Slavery"", and ""Ignorance Is Strength"". Further, the nation of Oceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, varying from day to day and reflected in the official propaganda of the state bureaucracy. All party members revere their leader ""Big Brother"" (perhaps reminiscent of Josef Stalin or other totalitarian dictators) and despise the rebellious ""Goldstein"" (perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet hatred for Leon Trotsky). Further, the party exists in a caste system in which the ""proles"" (the proletariat) live underneath the party members (who are divided into the Inner and Outer Party). Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth but begins to keep a diary (which is strictly forbidden to party members) in which he reflects his hatred for ""Big Brother"". His work involves developing propaganda for the party. At work he meets up with Julia, who he initially believes is a strict orthodox member of the party. However, eventually he comes to realize that Julia is in love with him and they have a secret encounter in the countryside. Eventually Julia expresses to Winston her complete loathing for the party, though she publicly maintains a persona of utter obeisance and orthodoxy and belongs to the ""Anti-sex League"". Together they find a new hiding place in a shop in a part of the city where the ""proles"" live and attempt to re-discover the past of England. Throughout this period, however, the two live in constant fear of the thought police, should they catch onto their affair. Eventually, Winston meets up with O'Brien at work, a man who he believes is a member of the Resistance, and is given a copy of Goldstein's book which explains the rise of the party and the need for perpetual war. Orwell quotes extensively from Goldstein's book which reflects much of the social thinking of the time, in particular the theory of managerial elites. However, Winston and Julia are captured by the party and it turns out that O'Brien is in fact a member of the party. While taken captive, both are tortured and made to recant their original beliefs about the party. In a particularly disgusting scene, Winston is taken to Room 101 where he must face his worst fear. There he ultimately betrays Julia (as she has already betrayed him) to save himself from being tortured by rats (the worst torture that he can imagine). Eventually, Winston is completely re-educated and made to love ""Big Brother"" while his relationship with Julia is forever changed after their mutual betrayals of each other. Thus, ends in the most horrifying of manners Orwell's classic novel. Orwell concludes with an appendix on ""The Principles of Newspeak"" which effectively shows how even the language itself can be put to the purposes of propaganda within a totalitarian state._1984_ remains a classic dystopia reflecting the darker side of human existence within the Twentieth Century as it played out in the totalitarian dictatorships of the age. Throughout this novel, the very notion of truth remains problematic, as the party re-defines history to reflect its own agenda and thus even memory itself becomes distorted. Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most. While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity. Orwell's novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism. As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most. While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity. Orwell's novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism. As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

9626341823,A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction),,AN4Q2ZSSXR05C,Megan,2/6,3.0,1018569600,The ways of Scrooge,"A Christmas Carol is a story of social conscious, where wrongs are righted and kindness prevails. Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth. Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes. The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment. They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge. He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment. He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate. Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesn&#65533;t trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly. It is the only pleasure he allows himself. He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different. Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off. Despite this, Bob is a happy man. He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home. The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, &#65533;but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.&#65533;The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit. His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man. He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man. Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience. His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family. He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed. A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers. His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others.",,

The children I particularly wanted to read this with were my 7-year-old daughter, and 8 and 11-year-old sons. While I wanted them to know the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his change of heart, I knew that the unabridged original version would probably be a bit much for my daughter to take in, and require a lot of explanations regarding the archaic language for my sons. So for us, The Great Illustration version of A Christmas Carol was perfect.This version has illustrations on just about every page, which was particularly important for my very visual younger children. This version stayed true to the original as I remembered it and kept the personality of Scrooge, from bitter old man to renewed and invigorated redeemed soul intact!I also felt that the use of modern English was not a disservice to the original. While reading about the death of Tiny Tim, I felt the same amount of emotion and pain as reading the original. In fact as my voice cracked and the tears started to well my little son, who is just beginning to truly appreciate the subtle nuances that make for a good reading said, ""Great expression, mom!""I have read some of the reviews of other books in this series as being too watered down, and that may be. But for this particular age group, I think this book in particular fills a special need. I think reading it as a family this season will leave a special impression on their young minds and hearts and make them want to pick this story up again when they are a bit older and able to handle more of a reading challenge.",['Charles Dickens'],['Fiction']

What about Enid's friend on the cruise...did we really need all that background? It was a chore to read and I'm very glad that it is all over now.

There is a great deal of somewhat simple-minded game-playing. There is an overweening self consciousness that occassionally intrudes into what is quite an excellent depcition of &quot;the sins of the fathers.&quot; The dysfunctionality of the family has been called contrived and unbelievable; however, as Tolstoy points out, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way.While I could have done with less of the pretention and game playing fewer sentences trying to suggest what parkinsonianism is about, less about the political climate of Lithuania, and less of the occasional overwritten verbal bombast (Particulary off-putting in the first couple of pages)--I still think the author has constructed a wonderful story and created characters that seemed very realistic to me. In fact, I was occassionally depressed to recognize some of these people among my own family and acquaintances.What Franzen's book ultimately did for me is make me ask the question, &quot;How does my life look from the outside?&quot; In that it provides a marvelous impetus for reflection and change. While Franzen seems dubious about that possibility, the novel has too short a duration in actual time to suggest whether or not the corrections will actually have a substantive effect on the characters.As I generally hate anything postmodern, I do give this two thumbs up--because if it was &quot;post-modern&quot; it was so in a way that was at least palatable and not inchoate.",['Jonathan Franzen'],['Fiction']

B00005QTHG,The Corrections,,,,1/1,4.0,1009324800,Franzen holds up a mirror to American life,"Jonathan Franzen has a finger right on the pulse of contemporary American society. This book spares little: Regionalism (the supposedly unsophisticated Midwest vs. the self-satisfied East coast), high-flying young investors with more money than taste, self-help books with cover-to-cover cliches and psychobabble, the &quot;promise&quot; of improved minds and personalities via treatments that alter brain chemistry, celebrity worship, materialism, SUV's (Stompers!), and teaching of the humanities as a cover for left-wing activism. As a &quot;social novelist&quot;, Franzen is reminiscent of Tom Wolfe.Even though I enjoyed the author's keen sensibilities, this novel taxed my patience until I was about halfway through. Initially, I found most of the characters to be unsympathetic and didn't care what became of them. Chip starts out as immature and phony. He is a leftist humanities professor who espouses feminist causes, yet objectifies women and sleeps with a student. When he gets canned from his tenure-track position, I thought he had it coming. Enid is very critical and has an almost pathological interest in what her better-off neighbors think. Gary is smug and materialistic. He and Chip are a kind of yin and yang. His wife, Caroline, is manipulative, lazy, and snobbish, and is more interested in being her children's friend than their mother. Their three boys are spoiled brats.Later in the novel, however, all of the characters (with the possible exception of Gary) change for the better. Franzen puts his characters under a microscope, and as the book went on I also became more aware of the fact that if anyone's life was scrutinized so closely, he or she probably wouldn't look so hot either. Franzen's characterizations make the reader work a bit, force him or her to be a little less judgmental.The main flaw in this novel is that it is longer than it needs to be.

Lamberts.Otherwise: I loved this book, and I rarely love anything this popular or trendy. This book is, in a way, a lot like a 19th century Russian Novel (though it is a &quot;Russian&quot; novel about Americans): it shares the Russian novel premise that people have very little control over their lives, and are basically doomed when they attempt to *correct* themselves. (you avarage American, on the other hand, believes that people have a huge amount of control over their lives. I guess the truth is in the middle but I digress).

On the most basic level, it has a soap opera thing going, and the travails of its characters draws you in. With that said, don't expect to like all the characters. They are most definitely flawed, and we see their vision of the world through their skewed views. The description of son Gary's depression, I belive, was dead-on, and I sympathized with him very much during his discover period.Basically we see each of these people as they go through major changes in their lives--Corrections, if you will. Each has gone so far in one direction and finds they must do some reversal soon or they won't survive it. In my own experience, these &quot;corrections&quot; are most often difficult and painful to experience and watch. All of the characters in &quot;The Corrections&quot; are basically good people, but you have to work to like them. If you need to really like the characters in the books you read, then this book is not for you. However, if you like interesting, multi-layered characters, then dive right in.The weakest aspect of the book, in my opinion, was son Chip's business venture in Lithuania.

B00005QTHG,The Corrections,,A2BW8ZI352D37P,The Gooch,5/7,4.0,1022544000,"Ignore the hype, enjoy the book","When a novel is published with the hype, publicity and media fanfare of ""The Corrections"" it seems to create an odd backlash. The book is rarely judged on its own merits, on whether of not it is simply a good, entertaining novel, but instead, judged on whether of not it is the greatest piece of literature ever created, an inherently unfair standard. There are probably a whole plethora of reasons as to why this is the case, from inflated expectations to the bizarre animosity many readers of ""serious"" fiction have with anything that becomes too popular or makes money. In other words, I would be willing to bet that had ""The Corrections"" been published without the immense fanfare, you would find its average Amazon.com user rating much higher, since people would be judging it on its own terms, instead of on whether or not it is deserving of its status as the ""it"" book of the time.After finishing, ""The Corrections"", two things are for sure: Franzen is an excellent writer, equally adept at both humor and drama, and he also has a keen and observant eye for human behavior. Franzen's characters are some of the most three-dimensional characters to ever hit the page. Each character is so fully fleshed out that it is hard to believe they are fictional. Franzen doesn't just give you just a base level understanding of each character and then move on, instead you get even the most subtle details of each characters personality. You have the overbearing mother, who stubbornly refuses to face reality, the repressed, distant father rapidly losing control of his body and mind, to their grown children, all of whom, in their own way, have made a mess of their own lives in an attempt to ""not be like their parents"". While the topic of dysfunctional families if far from original, it is rare to see the subject dealt with in such an entertaining and authentic way, without stereotypical characters or a convoluted plot.I had two criticisms of ""The Corrections"", having nothing to do with the story itself, but more to do with the length and pacing of the book. Each primary character in the novel is given his or her own section, almost like a novel within a novel, which, while serving to give the reader a detailed understanding of each character, did get a bit tedious. The section where the parents, Alfred and Enid, are on a seniors cruise was so long and often boring that after awhile I was ready to jump overboard myself. That chapter easily could have been cut down by half. Also, while I appreciated that each character was given equal coverage in the book, I thought the novel would have flowed better had it been paced differently. Instead of separating each characters story into individual sections, I think it would have been wiser to have interspersed between the various characters throughout the book. Franzen could have kept all the same information in the novel, but made each section seem less exhausting. Another problem with dedicating an individual section of the novel to each character was it made it a bit hard to keep all of the various stories straight. For example, Chip, the character who is the focus of the novel's first section, doesn't return until several hundred pages later, so by the time he reappeared I had forgotten so much about his situation that I had to spend an annoyingly long amount of time going back to the first section of the book to refresh my memory. Outside of these two complaints, I thought ""The Corrections"" was a solid effort.",['Jonathan Franzen'],['Fiction']

Sometimes that realization doesn't come until after you complete reading the book, which didn't seem all that profound while you were getting through it, however at the end it hits you. Such as is the case with this very unsettling novel ""The Corrections.""The story is in many ways a narrative of the Lambert family, comprised of patriarch Alfred, his wife Enid and offspring Gary, Denise and Chip. While Enid and Alfred have been married for decades, it's safe to say that the family is horribly dysfunctional.The story reflects on the history of the family and mostly on the impact of Alfred on the rest of his family. His decisions and choices in life impact the others for decades on end and provide the basis for the entire book.Along the way the author touches on a number of hot button subjects including dementia, caring for the aged, drug abuse, mental illness, drug therapies to treat mental illness, stock manipulaton and greed, sexual feelings and actions of various stripes, the irrational expectations that families place on its members, parenting and an overall examination of the meaning of life.The author weaves this story with a mix of humor and irony that sometimes is overwrought but it is compelling. I've noticed that a number of reviewers have complained about the characters in the book but that's probably because there are plenty of kernels of truth in this book that probably remind people too much of their own lives.The book made my very uncomfortable a number of times and I'm still grappling with some of its implications. The issues of caring for aged parents and the sometimes related issue of mental health among seniors is not an easy subject to confront. Luckily the book intersperses the uncomfortable with humor, but don't pick this book up if all you want is sweetness and light.Overall, I recommend the book and applaud the author for his courageous examination of these issues.",['Jonathan Franzen'],['Fiction']

A perfect compromise, I thought. I can experience the book without the repercussions that being seen with ""an Oprah book"" would bring to my stellar reputation.I told you I was a snob.The Corrections is about the Lambert family: Alfred, the father; Enid, the mother; and Chip, Gary, and Denise, the children; and their lives and relationships with each other and fringe people. Alfred is stubbornly refusing to believe his slow descent into senility. Enid wants her quickly spreading family to have one last Christmas together. Chip is struggling with losing his teaching job due to a wild drugged-out weekend with a student. Gary is attempting to receive the money his father refused from an invention from long ago that a large conglomerate is using in a breakthrough pharmaceutical that, ironically, could treat Alfred's dementia. And Denise is having difficulty separating her work and sex lives.Each family member's story interlaces with others and those of people involved in their lives. I found the family's stories much more interesting that those of unrelated folks, but the book as a whole is phenomenal. Franzen comes from the modern flock of literary authors like David Foster Wallace who sprinkle pop-culture references and new uses of words within a basic story framework, making the reading of a novel once again a ""novel"" experience.Despite Franzen's (and my) biases against certain types of publicity, he has written a book that deserves all the praise and fame that it can get, from whatever the source.

There are apparently lots of people, some of them on prestigious award committees, who love the way this man writes. Personally I cannot fathom why. To me, the writing reeks of narcissism. While struggling through the book I had a persistent mental image of the author as an insufferably pompous academic, smirking to himself as he typed out ironically modest responses to his fan email, the majority of which had been sent by pompous academics exactly like him.But then, Oprah liked this book enough to choose it for her book club, and she's hardly pompous.

The characters were revealed to have motivations that originated outside themselves and suddenly it became impossible to care about them. As they became absurd in Franzen's eyes, they became absurd in mine. He abandoned them and cut them down to less than human fictive types. They were no longer human beings and hence I felt little for them in the end. I think this is a very good book except for Franzen's fatal misstep. His desire to be cool, to not seem to be investing too much of himself in his characters emptied the book of a sincerity it needs to succeed as a humane and human document.

B00005VOED,A confederacy of dunces,,,,2/4,3.0,880502400,"Review of A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole","I am from New Orleans, a lifelong native and resident. I read this book when I was 19 years old (for the first time) and then just recently at my grand old age of thirty something. I remember the hype from the English Department at the University of New Orleans-the year was 1981 and I had to read the book for an English course. Constantly, over and over again, I heard what a great book this was, and I agreed-somewhat. My problem with the story back then was because it seemed like a masterpiece to me for the first few chapters, but then the plot bogged down in a mire of excessive sleaze. I have lived and worked in the French Quarter for several years, and I can say that the individuals who live on the fringe of society there are definately NOT like Toole's depiction of characters like Liz Steele or Betty Bumper, Dorian Green or Lana Lane. Toole is writing about an era that is today all but faded, an era of New Orleans rapidly descending into forgotten lore. The Irish Third Ward is today an inner city wasteland of decrepit houses and crumbling warehouses, and in the quarter, you are more likely to see characters from all over the country with a myriad of traits all differant from each other. The Quarter is a crowded, tight space today and the ghosts of the past are all leaving. But still, there are many still alive-the majority, I would think-who remember the old ways and crack a grin at this novel. But as a young man of 19 years, I thought it was mediocre at best because of the way Toole packed it with sleaze and what is now almost anachronisms, anachronisms that tend to remind me of my parents and grandparents, betraying the great promise the first few chapters displayed. Today, I am repulsed by the similarity between this book and William Faulkner's short story, &quot; A Rose for Emily.&quot; The thematic similarity is clear; Toole's story takes place about the time Old New Orleans was starting to fade into the modern era of the Superdome, Poydras Street and the World's Fair. Faulkner's short story takes place near the end of the Old South. In both of these stories the images of decay are present. I am reminded that Toole is a southern writer, but his book is like a sad commentary on the often mentioned flight to the suburbs taken by many of the urban middle-class, a flight which began in the sixties, leaving mostly undesireables in the downtown area. I give this book a &quot;6&quot; because Toole uses very accurate dialogue and cultural referances, but the over-all impact of the novel is too weary; the sleaze fest becomes offensive.",['John Kennedy Toole'],['Fiction']

I read the entire book because of the high praise it has received. To be honest, I wanted to toss it after two chapters. I have a very good sense of humor. Salman Rushdie's &quot;The Moor's Last Sigh&quot; made me laugh for hours on end. This book did nothing but depress and disgust me. If Toole's life was anything like Reilly's, I can understand his depression. The quality of the writing and the level of imagination exhibited in the book are both very high. As a literary study the book has merit (the Pulitzer is questionable). This book unequivocally did not live up to the jacket reviews.",['John Kennedy Toole'],['Fiction']

I know far too many people that are just as awful and obnoxious as the charecters in it. Very vivid, very depressing. The only character I would really want to spend time with was the cloud of smoke that is Jones. The book was worth it just for Jones.My main problem with the book was that it failed to make me laugh. This wouldn't be a problem normally. I don't expect books to be laughfests as a rule, but everyone said &quot;Oh, it's soo hilarious! I was cracking up the whole time I read it!&quot; So I had to read it for a literature class. My teacher said it is a masterpeice. It won the Pulitzer Prize! So I was expecting to laugh this time. But I couldn't. It was just too depressing. I told my teacher I didn't think it was funny. He asked my classmates if they thought it was funny and they all said yes. My teacher quoted Jonathon Winters, who said that the scariest person in the world is someone without a sense of humor.So maybe I don't have a sense of humor, but I find it difficult to see the point of laughing at miserable people who make each other more miserable. There are also a lot of sex jokes and a lot of jokes about passing gas, but I can get that from Beavis and Butthead.My teacher also said the whole book was about scorn. It is supposed to make you feel beter about yourself because you're not as horrible as the people in the book, but I think my ego was okay without having read this book.But I liked Toole's style. The dialogues and descriptions are wonderful. The book is great as a description of the burgeoning chaos of the early sixties. It just didn't make me laugh.",['John Kennedy Toole'],['Fiction']
B00005VOED,A confederacy of dunces,,A3CBRJI43KAF4S,"""jburke7445""",28/37,4.0,1026086400,"Don't believe the hype. Well, believe some of it.","One thing must be made perfectly clear from the start -- this is an extremely fun book to read. It's funny, it's paced well; it's a terrific summer read. That said, however, I don't think this is quite the Great American Novel the critics have declared it to be. My suspicion is that many of them are more excited about HOW it came to be than WHAT it came to be. Just as music critics dream of breaking some obscure-but-magical band they just happened to hear in a small-town bar, this work -- written by a talented-but-troubled young man, forgotten for years after his suicide, discovered by his mother is some musty cabinet, dropped on the desk of a skeptical English professor, begrudgingly read, then found to be a masterpiece -- proved too tempting; it's TOO perfect. So go into this knowing that the book's legacy probably has as much to with its lavish praise as its content.I found the book to be a bit like a kiddie pool -- colorful, fun, inviting, but, while broad enough to hold many characters, ultimately very shallow. Certainly, many of the characters were given magnificent, hilarious dialogue (although Burma's constant ""Hey!""s and ""Whoa!""s baffled me; was he being shot at, did he have Tourette's?), but they weren't given much life; we never got to know them. Miss Trixie, Lana Lee and Mrs. Levy, for instance, were given a hook line and esentially repeated it ad nauseum for the rest of the novel. And once the roster was divided into good guys and bad guys, the book marched on to a fairly predictable end.Even our enormous, over-educated, cripplingly neurotic, eternally belching anti-hero Ignatius was ultimately little more than a vehicle for Toole's amazing monologues. While we were given tiny glimpses of his humanity, an awful high school experience, his heartbreak over his departed dog, his secret love for the movies, we never learned what made him tick. WHY was he so rabidly averse to sex, obsessed with pre-Renaisannce history, undermotivated and fearful? What in his childhood or college experience molded him, changed him?That said, though, the book IS pretty darned funny and has some of the most twisted twists ever. Ignatius' near-success in organizing a full-blown religious crusade with a pack of bemused, semi-literate factory workers had me rolling, and his, er... unique plan to inflitrate the armed forces to bring about a new era of world peace had to be one of the most hilariously fiendish concepts in recent memory -- it seemed as though it actually MIGHT work. All of the character plots tied together beautifully and, although their eventual outcomes are fairly obvious, the roads which led them there are anything but.So know that this is not one of the greats, nor is there a Big Message, other than that desperate self-preservation will generally triumph over either secular humanism or staunch religious morality. Know also, though, that you will have a heck of a good time reading this. Perhaps not a leather-bound tome to be positioned among the classics in a college library, but a great addition to the pile of paperbacks in your rented beach house.",['John Kennedy Toole'],['Fiction']

It's a book beloved by so many people (my husband among them), yet it's reviled by probably equally as many. I had a very hard time determining which side I was on. I think I may be one of the very few sitting on the fence.Toole's characterization of Ignatius is indeed a brilliant portrayal of a self-centered, lazy, cynical and repulsive man, but I had a hard time finding his exploits funny. I've met people like Ignatius, and quite frankly, I want to get away from them, not indulge them as they attempt to skew the rest of the world their way. I truly despised Ignatius, and couldn't wait to finish the book to be rid of him.But, how can I fault an author who managed to evoke such a strong feeling of disgust from me? That's obviously the result of some darn fine writing. The story flows smoothly, combining Ignatius' misadventures with those of the other characters in a climactic conclusion that brought them all together an effectively amusing little tangle. So here I sit on the fence - I don't want to meet Ignatius again any time soon, but I don't regret having spent a little time with him.",['John Kennedy Toole'],['Fiction']

It is the story of the adventures of one Ignatius J. Reilly, a social misfit from Uptown New Orleans, and his interactions with a bunch of stereotypical New Orleans characters.This book is one of four books often mentioned as mandatory reading for anyone wanting to understand New Orleans ( Incidentally, the other three are TN Williams' Streetcar Named Desire, Walker Percy's the Moviegoer, and Kate Chopin's The Awakening). Many people love Confederacy, and many people, though probably not as many, don't. After a second reading I confirmed my initial reaction and again firmly place myself in the ""don't"" category. Undoubtedly, the book has some major things going for it ( as do most Pulitizer Prize winning novels ). Toole nails New Orleans cold. The dialogue is great.One might enjoy the novel if for no other reason than listening to Ignatius' mama and her friend, Santa, pass the time of day in conversation. His depiction of Uptown New Orleans and the French Quarter are again right on the money. As someone who lives in the Quarter, I especialy enjoyed his depiction of my neighborhood. The plot comes together quite well. But, God, I found the characters, especially Ignatius, just horrible people without many redeeming social values at all. And, after two readings with very few chuckles, I just don't get how so many readers think this is not only a laugh out loud novel, but maybe the greatest such novel ever written.But what do I know ?

Dumas' novel is less an action story than a testiment to human endurance, ingenuity, and ultimately, self-forgivness. The story's protaganist, Edmund Dantes, is sent to prison on false charges where he lingers for years. During his unjust incarceration he mets a fellow inmate who teaches him, guides him, and also bestows upon him a fortune. Dantes uses this fortune to set a plan into action. For years he has dreamed of revenge against the men who put him in prison and now he will have it.

The community is an excellent example on how fictional this story really is. If the reader reads this story they might think this could be a real community somewhere on earth. The book does not have families that live in houses. They have family units that live in dwellings. To me dwellings are considered where animals live. Another thing that is fictional is people asking for release. This day and age you can't just say I want to apply for release because I am too old or I can't handle this job. Also, you can't just kill a twin baby because it is smaller and it might produce problems with the family. In this day and age you have to deal with things as they come to you. The community that Lois Lowry created for the reader is very fascinating and creative. She has an excellent imagination. There were a couple of questions I kept asking myself as I was reading the story. Who would want to become a birthmother and give the baby away after she was producing her own children? Why would they have ceremonies for kids becoming a 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. and not a regular birthday? Why would you want a child that has already been named for you? Wouldn't the family units want to name it themselves? Maybe the community has it's reasons for these types of crazy laws they have but if they knew the way the world worked today I am almost sure they would want to live their life a whole different way.",['Lois Lowry'],['Juvenile Fiction']

"" Jonas"" it was a whisper at first... Then louder, faster. ""Jonas, Jonas, Jonas"".The Giver written by Lois Lowry is set in the future in a place where there is no snow and no sunshine. Life is bland. People have forgotten how to see color. Life is perfect with no sorrow, hunger or war. Unlike our world today in Jonas's world there are no choices. Your role in life is assigned to you. The main character in this book is Jonas who at the age of twelve is assigned the task of becoming the next Receiver of Memory. Unlike the others Jonas is different. He begins to see color and understand the true meaning of pain. Jonas has two friends whose names are Asher and Fiona. Asher puts a bit of laughter into The Giver. "" I want my smack!"" he once said instead of snack.The theme of the book is about ignorance. How Jonas's community does not want to look back and instead they place the burden on The Receiver of Memory. The Giver is about Jonas who at his assignment ceremony is given the task of the Receiver of Memory. He is trained by The Giver to receive memories.

Beveridge ""xterminal""",0/0,4.0,1233964800,Good all-ages reading.,"Louis Sachar, Holes (Yearling, 1998)A wonderful little book, this, that wraps family drama, black comedy, crime and punishment, and (manufactured, but still) history rolled into one. Made into an exceptionally enjoyable movie in 2003; as usual, the book is better, but in this case only slightly so.Stanley Yelnats comes from a long line of family members with awful luck. As we open, he gets hit on the head with a pair of shoes. That may be bad enough luck, but it turns out these shoes are celebrity shoes, and were stolen from a local homeless shelter, landing Stanley at Camp Green Lake. The idea of discipline at Camp Green Lake is to have the prisoners (excuse me, campers) dig holes, five-foot deep and five-foot wide holes, one a day, until they've served out their sentence. This is obviously not just discipline; the camp's counselors are obviously looking for something. But what? Meanwhile, Stanley, who's never really been the social type, gradually becomes friends with some of his cabin mates, especially Zero, who shares a secret with Stanley that he's shared with no one else. All this is intermixed with the story of how the Yelnats clan found themselves cursed, and what the curse has wrought over the successive generations of Yelnatses.I saw the movie a few years ago, and having seen it, expected the book to be more broadly funny than it is. Sachar definitely mainstreamed the humor for the film audience, for the comedy in the book is black, black, black. Expect your laughs to be a bit on the uncomfortable side here. Otherwise, however, everything is about as you'd expect if you've seen the movie; it's well-plotted, the characters are rich and well-drawn, the pacing is impeccable.

Indeed, the correspondence between John and Abigail generally overwhelms all other aspects of the narrative. The historical events in which Adams played such a large part are too often hidden from view, as if seen through a gauze curtain.Then, too, in his justifiable admiration of Adams, McCullough seems to think it necessary to denigrate Thomas Jefferson, notwithstanding that Jefferson and Adams were partners in the revolution and ended their lives (on the same day, in fact) as extremely close personal friends. Too much of the criticism of Jefferson seems forced and out of context.I am glad McCullough has written about Adams, because McCullough's reputation assures that another generation of Americans will learn about Adams and his times.

McCullough's unhurried narration takes the reader through as much of John Adams' life as he can weave without loose ends. The story is complete.Adams was a prolific writer of letters and a life-long keeper of journals. McCullough relies on these, plus the letters of others, journalism and other public records, and the notes, writings and published anecdotes from later Adamses, to cast his story. He also uses them as literary vehicles to give the reader an effective understanding and appreciation of the times and of Adams' character.That character was as simple and straightforward as it was complex. Adams was a vain, ambitious, stubborn and opinionated provincial on one hand; and a persevering and committed idealist of great integrity on the other. He was determined, energetic, insightful, decisive and consistent. Whereas he was able to see all issues writ large, his actions, in turn, were often viewed narrowly. Like George Washington, he gave no quarter to politics and, unable to play at them, was often their victim. But throughout, the causes of American independence and human liberty defined him, and he shared their integrity.McCullough does not present a high-handed criticism of Adams. But he is no apologist, either. He simply gives us the Adams of historical record. As Washington is termed the father of our country; Madison of the constitution; Hamilton, the U.S. Treasury; and so forth; McCullough leaves the reader to realize that John Adams, too often overlooked, was indeed the Father of our American Independence.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']
B0001PIOWU,John Adams,,AILSFAMMVHVCK,Roger L. Lee,2/3,5.0,999043200,"If you are a proud USA citizen, read this.","JOHN ADAMS by David McCulloughThis biography should be required reading before the first year of college. John Adams had so much to do with the making of the America government that his story is the story of America. He helped write the Declaration of Independence and was there every step of the way to make sure it was implemented. As a signer of the document and one of the most enthusiastic and involved American for independence, he was a traitor to England and was to be put to death by the English. In none of his correspondence with the English, French and to his fellow American did he waver is his determination to see a free American. This review would not be complete without the contributions that were made throughout the book by Abigail, John Adams wife who was another prodigious letter writer. She wrote about the events that were happening and she wrote with comments. At the same time the health and well being of the family was first. Because of John's position as an envoy to France and the Dutch Court and a minister to The Court of St. James in England his wife was not with him a great deal of the time. Crossing the Atlantic in a sailing ship was a long, more than three-month adventure, and John did it twice. Later, on John's second voyage, Abigail went to him in spite of her fear of sailing the Atlantic. David McCullough kept the story interesting. This of type of biography can be very dry. It helped that John Adams was a prodigious writer--with letter in his own hand and memoriam after memoriam of every thing including his trips across the Atlantic. John Adams donated his whole life to America and its freedom for the people. Even when retired and writing again his main subject was America. To accept the job of writing a biography for John Adams and do it honestly to the memory of John Adams was an admirable project. John Adams's first test was the trial of the British Captain and the six solders that killed five men in what was then called the Boston Massacre. The 34-year-old John was to defend the Captain and the solders. He did this without letting his person feeling or the personal feeling of his American friends interfere. The captain was found not guilty and four of the solders were found not guilty. Two were found guilty of manslaughter and were branded on their thumbs.John was busy with his duties to Congress and very worried about his family when he was not there to help-which was very often. His family was living near Boston during a Smallpox plague. Dr. Zabdiel Boylston a great uncle of John Adams introduced the smallpox inoculation in America approximately 1716. An African Slave named Onesimus said that the practice had been practiced for a long time in Africa. He had a scar on his arm to prove it. Abigail, John Adams wife, had the children inoculated against Smallpox with success when it was a very new and untried procedure. One more very drastic medical problem at the time of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of War, with the British warships already in the area. America fought the Revolution War without a president or a vice president. George Washington was the American general who reported directly to congress. John Adams was the first Vice President to George Washington who was the first President. They had not decided what John's pay would be. The two wealthiest men in the nation at this time were Franklin and Washington who both supported the idea of public officials serving without pay. John was opposed to the idea that the public officials would serve without pay besides he couldn't afford to serve under those rules. He had written earlier when he was in England that under the circumstances of not being paid, ""all offices would be monopolized by the rich.""David McCullough did a good job or picking out the parts of the documents which meant something to America and John Adams and belong in this biography. I really felt as thought I'd met John Adams and liked him after reading David McCullough's biography. I believe John Adams would have liked this history of his life. John Adams was a man who picked out his own weaknesses; he not only picked them out, but also attempted to correct them. I imagine that egoism will always be a problem with people in politics.

The history I was taught never seemed very inspiring. Fowarding to 32 years of age, U.S. History couldn't be more fascinating. The JOHN ADAMS chronology of Adams life was informative, inspirational and will certainly spur me on to read more about the U.S. founding fathers. Through a combination of both great subject matter, and an entertaining writting style, JOHN ADAMS is a book I would recommend to anyone who would like to give their history lessons a second chance. This book should be required reading for all politicians today. It outlines some of the great concepts this country was built on - as reconstructed from the actual voluminous records of correspondance at the time and place of the U.S. birth. At the same time, this book also evidences the sadly all too human nature to bastardize great theoretical concepts through misguided self-interests. The political intrigue, even among some of these assumedly (and incorrectly) unreproachable &quot;founding fathers&quot; is fascinating. You couldn't ask for a more pure initial experiment then that of american independance as outlined in the pages of JOHN ADAMS.

B0001PIOWU,John Adams,,A3EGNZLFHPH40H,Susan Symington,4/6,5.0,1010620800,Help for Post 9/11 America,"I want to thank David McCullough for writing a book that helped me--and I believe can help others--get through a trying time in our history. The John Adams illuminated here was certainly not a flawless man, but one who rose to greatness when it was required through sacrifice, devotion to country, and devotion to the ideal of liberty. Although ordinarily I am not a biography reader, in searching for something that would hold my interest after September 11 and yet not seem frivolous, I found this book to be the perfect read--in fact, I could not put it down and read it for hours at a time. Dry and dull, it is not. On the contrary, it is absorbing account of the lives of our American heroes (and heroines, since I would certainly include Abigail in any such list) which reminds us of the truly inspiring people who form the American &quot;stock.&quot; That is not to say they were great solely because of the European tradition they came from, but because they embodied the American ideals that attract all of us, no matter when we immigrated or from where. Adams was visionary in his sense of how this country could be different from anything that had come before, and as McCullough tells it--with ample use of Adams' own words--his own eloquence and passion were at several points crucial in setting the young republic on its historic course.The best part of the book, I felt, was McCullough's frequent and well-placed use of the words of those who were living at the time, as well as his development of the broader historical context in which Adams lived and wrote. I am surely not the only reader who will marvel at the copious writings of both Adamses and their many correspondents, and wonder how our own generations to come will find out so much about us.Less successful, in my opinion, was the way in which McCullough introduced an event and then switched back to the times leading up to the event (perhaps this was just me, but I found myself disoriented a bit by this device and not sure exactly when things happened). All in all, however, an absorbing and inspiring book that I can heartily recommend to readers of both fiction and non-fiction who would appreciate a dose of post 9/11 comfort and joy.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']

B0001PIOWU,John Adams,,A2A6GWP1ADFEQ7,M. A Newman,3/4,5.0,1056412800,The Founding Father,"For many years Adams was overshadowed by many of the other ""founding fathers."" This book by David McCullough attempts to redress this balance.Though not the great writer that Thonas Jefferson was, nor the awe-inspiring figure of Washington, Adams's contribution was more broad and in someways more effective. Without the contribution of John Adams, the passage of the Declaration of Independence might never have happened. While Jefferson was able to distill the essence of the Enlightenment in that remarkable document, Adams was the one who persuaded congress to vote for it. It was the support of Adams the ensured Washington's appointment as commander in chief of the contenental army. Both of these gentlemen owe their later glory to Adams's behind the scenes operations.In a sense this sort of thing was what Adams excelled. Washington may have led troops in battle (with mixed results) and Benjamin Franklin may have charmed the French, but Adams secured loans from Dutch Bankers that made the American Republic a reality.McCullough's efforts to restore Adams to prominence take all this into account. He clearly admires Adams as person and for his accomplishments. Perhaps his finest hour was when president and managed in defiance of his own party (particularly a dangerously unstable Hamilton), by a mixture of carrots and sticks to keep the peace. While military glory might be the sort of thing to inspire blockbuster history paintings and burnish the reputation with everlasting glory, but Adams knew that America could not win this war and there was scant reason to risk the work of a lifetime (the establishment of the American republic)for war with France. Hamilton seemed to be urging war mainly out of a sense of pique. He would have been at home on many of the TV chat shows today. Hamilton's actions during this period probably are the strongest arguement for euthanising retired politicians, or least urging them to take up a hobby. When Adams left public life he read the classics and did as Voltaire urged, he tended his garden. In this as in many other stages of his life, Adams set a good example.Adams may have been at his best operating behind the scenes, he was at his worst when leader of the Federalist Party. While MCCullough lauds the insistance of putting principle over party, this did diminish Adams effectiveness as chief executive. He was better at selecting effective subordinates, John Marshall for instance than he was running a political party. If he had sacked George Washington's cabinet (which was filled with Hamilton's cats paws) and selected his own, one wonders how things might have been different.This book is one of the best on Adams ever written. Although it is not without its flaws. I think McCullough might have been a bit more harsh on Adams over the Alien and Sedition acts. His involvement with these two acts has undermined and overshadowed his reputation for many years. I think that perhaps McCullough's admiration for his subject might have overwhelmed his critical faculties. McCullough also gives short shift to the political writings of John Adams. While not as influental as those of Hamilton and Jefferson (and whose are?), they do represent a kind of halfway house between the two. Filled with a mixture of good sense and scholarship, they deserved more attention. In this area Page Smith's book does a better job in this issue. Despite these shortcomings, I can give this book the highest possible recommendation.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']

He writes in a fluid, narrative form that makes the book easy and interestimg to read, and John Adams seem to be a a real human being with whom you can relate. He deals with Adam's faults as well as his positive traits, and his challenges and relationships with others, as well as his love and respect for Abigail. A remarkable man.One reviewer bemoans Adams' and Jefferson's attitude toward slavery and the fact that the ""slave trade"" was not condemned in the Declaration of Independence, forgetting, apparently, that the slaves were legally purchased valuable property then, and that at the time, slave holding was an accepted practice throughout the world. The Congress at the time was trying to bind the states together, not to drive wedges between them.This book does not indulge in questioning the cultural practices at the time of John Adams, but rather attempts to describe and explain them. I think the author does a masterful job, and depicts the genius of our founding fathers--and especially John Adams--as accurately as possible. I think he does a wonderful job, and makes the history of the day a delight to read, and understand.As far as I am concerned, at least, McCullough has done a masterful job, and he depicts John Admas and his contemporaries neutrally, while still remaining sympathetic to their problems and the fine line they walked in seeking their independence from Great Britain, putting their lives on the line in the process.I fail to see how any American today can find fault with the fathers of our country, considering the information they had, the education available to them, and the monumental task they faced. For myself, I am unutterably grateful that such men were available, with their wisdom and foresight.I am particularly impressed that they recognized the dangers of a democratic form of government, and rejected it in favor of a Constitutional representative republic, which, it seems, since that time we have gradually, insidiously, relinguished in favor of the socialism we are living under today, irrespective of the Constitution they so carefully crafted.John Adams, as our first vice-president, second president, representative to France and England, and a recognized genius by most historians was certainly one of the most influential of our founders, and deserves the gratitude of us all, considering his life in retrospect.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN(Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']

Adams and Truman shared several characteristics that I admire -- a sense of ethics that precluded each from attaining great wealth; a lifelong friendship and devotion to their spouses; and ability to separate their political and governmental personalities separate.The point of embarcation for the biography is before Adams was born, with the stories of the families of Adams' parents in Braintree, Massachusetts. We read of Adams' birth, life on his family's farm, education, reading, and becoming a lawyer. We read how, like everyone else, Adams had the British-American conflict thrust upon his life. His integrity often cost him friends, as when he defended the British soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre, and money, when he chose a career of public service over a law practice. Although he travelled the Atlantic to represent his country in Europe, and his governmental obligations carried him to Philadelphia, New York, and finally to what we now call Washington, one gathers that Adams would have been happy never to set foot out of the state of Massachusetts had it been possible. From the period of the end of his presidency to the end of his life, the book focuses on Adams' personal relationships -- with his wife, his grown children, his fellow signers of the Declaration of Independence, and of course Thomas Jefferson. I was disappointed, however, that there was no mention of two episodes that I associate closely with Adams. The first, and less significant perhaps, is the Treaty with Tripoli, and its enigmatic declaration that the United States was not a Christian nation. The second episode, much more important to any student of American history, was the famous Supreme Court decision in Marbury v. Madison and Adams' (and Jefferson's) roles in the shaping of the 19th Century federal judiciary. There is no mention of this case in the book; the closest reference is to the fact that Jefferson undid Adams' Judiciary Act, one of Adams's proudest achievements.People wrote more skillfully, and more often, in the 18th Century than the 21st, and Adams was a prolific writer even in his age. McCullough relies heavily on Adams' voluminous correspondence in fleshing out the story of our second President under the current constitution. This style works well throughout almost the entire book, but at the end the narrative feels more like a summary of Adams' correspondence.I recommend this book to anyone interested in an oft overlooked founding father, John Adams.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']

He really isn't all that interesting.That said, this book is far more interesting when dealing with the other characters involved. For example, we have Benjamin Franklin stabbing John Adams in the back, and we have Thomas Jeffereson stating that he needs his slaves for their labor to help pull him out of debt. We have the French trying to use the nearly independent United States for their own profit (not a big suprise there, eh?!). And the English trying to ignore the United States.The author did a very good job making a book on John Adams interesting, but I found the interesting parts were about everything except John Adams. John Adams was just another politician, but he was different in that he was HONEST and was really concerned about his country more than his own interests. But we really don't learn why John Adams is so patriotic. Why did he take a chance on losing all he had to support the American Revolution--I don't know from reading this book. We also learn relatively nothing about Adams' early life before the Revolutionary time. In the end, this isn't so much a biography of Adams as it is a description of a segment of time in which Adams lived and the part he took in it.I also found that the author tried to make Adams into a hero, which maybe he was, but the author did gloss over or totally ignored seemingly all of Adams faults, while giving us a glowing review of his better side. For example, whenever Adams has a problem with other people (Franklin, Jefferson, or whoever) it seems the other guy--never Adams--is to blame.All in all, it is just an okay book.

While the importance of his role in the early history of this country may not be completely forgotten, it certainly has been overshadowed. He was an outspoken proponent of independence in the Continental Congress. His success in securing aid from France and the Netherlands was critical to the success of the Revolution.

The owner touted it as a good read...and it is a good, interesting book.John Adams was interested in politics early in life, first in local politics and then as the Massachusetts delegate to the Continental Congress. From there, he never stopped being a politician, ambassador, Vice President and finally the first one-term President. His years as VP and President were contentious and unhappy. It wasn't until both men were long retired that he renewed his friendship with Thomas Jefferson.He retired to his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts and lived comfortably until his death. His wife, Abigail, died a few years before him, but he continued to be surrounded by family members after she died. They had had a good life together; they saw the country grow; they had lived in Europe and traveled there extensively. He lived to see his oldest son, John Quincy, become the sixth president of the US.Adams knew politics when he said, ""Ambition is one of the more ungovernable passions of the human heart. The love of power is insatiable and uncontrollable..."" (Sounds like George and Dick to me.) He had foresight...he was a big proponent of independence but looked beyond independence and the outcome of the war to what would be established once independence was achieved. ""The happiness of the people was the purpose of government,"" he wrote. (Are we happy today?)Unfortunately, no lessons have been learned in the last 200+ years and much is still the same.

The scenes it creates are compelling, and the quotations from Adams' letters and other writings are well-used. However, Adams' faults are glossed over, and when there was a difference of opinion between Adams and his contemporaries, Adams' viewpoint almost always prevails, often without referring to the contradictory evidence. McCullough says in his Acknowledgements that he relied on ""The Age of Federalism"" by Eric McKitrick and Stanley Elkins, but yet ignores statements in that book contrary to Adams' view. For instance, he says that Hamilton came uninvited in October 1798 to Trenton to argue Adams out of negotiating with France. Yet Elkins and McKitrick say that Hamilton came to Trenton to confer with one of the generals about the disposition of the army and didn't know until he arrived that Adams was there. McCullough also claims that Adams decided by August 4 1798 to send negotiators to France and told his secretary of state to delay nothing. Yet Elkins and McKitrick say that subsequently he informed Navy Secretary Stoddert that the envoys' departure could be suspended if news came making it advisable, and news did come in terms of a change in the membership of the French Directorate. In another part of the book, McCullough says that in the Jay treaty, the US gave up every point to the British. Elkins & McKitrick say that Jay got all the main points of contention: British evacuation of the western posts (which opened up the Northwest territories to expansion), compensation for the British seizures of American ships, and admission into the West Indies. There are other matters which McCullough failed to explain, (which Elkins & McKitrick do explain)such as the differences between Hamilton and some of his supporters in Adams' cabinet, their reasons for seeking Hamilton's advice and their concerns that Adams didn't consult with them, and ( a matter not included in Elkins & McKitrick, but covered in other works such as Stacy Shiff's book about the negotiations with the French) Franklin's side of the disputes with Adams in Paris.

Abigail and John Quincy emerge as far more impressive and interesting than John Adams himself. Their personalities and temperaments are revealed expertly, and you really do end up feeling like you know and understand them all. McCullough's writing is clear and his expert use of private letters makes the account almost as fascinating as ""1776"".Maybe it is his reliance on letters that explain it, or something else, but McCullough privileges the private over the public far too much. The biography succeeeds as a domestic portrait and perhaps also as a psychological study. But it disappoints as a work of history.I'm not left with a clear sense of how John Adams was shaped by the culture and events he lived through. Was Adams a man of his times? Behind his times? Ahead of his times? Hard to tell, as McCullough neglects ""the times"".I'm not left with any kind of profound appreciation (as in ""understanding"") of John Adams' accomplishments; the things he did to shape the culture and events he lived through. McCullough does describe them, but casts Adams more as someone who reflects or comments on events than as a partcipant in them. McCullough manages to make a forceful personality seem passive. Adams' tendency toward fatalism may be a partial explanation, but McCullough seems to put too much emphasis on his subject's words compared to his actions.Adams' long relationship with Jefferson is handled very unevenly. For example, the two men disagreed radically on the role of ""the Church"" vis a vis ""the State"", yet McCullough barely mentions this and doesn't answer any questions about how this affected their relationship, etc. McCullough states THAT Adams and Jefferson discussed religion in their later letters, but not what either had to say. He devotes more time to their shared love of gardening than to their opposing views on religion!

Unfortunately, he does it by elevating Adams to ridiculous heights, denigrating all others around him in order to make him appear to be the sole reason we have a country in the first place. Adams himself knew better; he was the self-described ""obnoxious, suspected and unpopular"" man who dreamed of exalted titles, whined about Franklin's success with the French, could not wrap his thick Yankee head around anything that was different from Braintree, disowned his son, SIGNED THE ALIEN AND SEDITION ACTS, committed the sad ""midnight appointments"" just before Jefferson's inauguration and left the White House an embittered man in the middle of the night to avoid the event. What's more, there are scenes created out of whole cloth where Adams directed a naval attack on a British ship, single handedly brought Talleyrand to the negotiation table and had to rebuff Jefferson's suggestion that he break the stalemate known as the election of 1800. Many of these stories are just that; scholars have always known that Adams wrote his memoirs many years after the events in question, and his memory proved unreliable, and usually worked to make himself the best man in all situations. That's why he's America's ""forgotten patriot"". He was vain, his take on events was ""suspected"" and he had the luxury of outliving most of the others so he could rewrite history as well (and then have his family build a special mausoleum just to store his voluminous papers). Rational thought must play a part. Surely, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, McHenry, et al could not have all been bad, deceitful men at those critical periods of our nation's history.

I was so enthralled and mesmerized by every aspect of the John Adams production that I watched it more than 5 times in a row, then bought the book and unabridged audio CD's by David McCullough.I assumed the Pulitzer prize winning book by McCullough would be a work of art (judging by the quality of the miniseries) and thought the book would enhance the enjoyment of the John Adams miniseries. To my dismay, the quality of writing in this book was equivalent with the immature skills of a pre-teen, junior high school student with a grade average of C-.Although there appeared to be great effort in gathering historical information about the life of John Adams, it was poorly organized, jumping around between dates without warning... leaping back and forth in time. One minute, it starts with John Adams headed to a colonial conference in Philadelphia with a servant... then the next moment, he is back in his childhood. This poor organization of timelines was bad enough, but I had expected a Pulitzer prize winning book to have been written with superb grammar and skillful wording befitting an accomplished author. Instead, I found it to be fraught with poor, rambling grammar, immature preteen phrasing and timeline hopping.The poor quality of writing was a significant disappointment. However, the book did contain additional historical information which I was seeking. After reading this book, it was obvious that the brilliant writing and dialogue of the ""John Adams"" miniseries was the skill and talent of the screenwriter, Kirk Ellis... not McCullough. It was Kirk Ellis, Tom Hanks and Tom Hooper who were responsible for creating the masterpiece miniseries film, ""John Adams""... as well as the outstanding acting of Giamanti and Linney. The choice of cast members for each role could not have been better. Each actor became the character they were portraying as if the original founding fathers had come to life. The film was the most exceptional, outstanding productions I have ever seen.The additional historical information (albeit, disorganized) was the only saving grace of the McCullough book... UNTIL I bought the DVD of the 1976 PBS Series ""The Adams Chronicles"".To my utter surprise, I discovered this 1976 PBS series contained nearly every bit of information contained in McCullough's book on John Adams (laid out in proper order and context). McCullough's book on John Adams is nearly word for word, verbatim from the 1976 PBS series, ""The Adams Chronicles"" which was also an award-winning series as was ""John Adams"". The only difference from McCullough's book, was that the 1976 PBS production of ""The Adams Chronicles"" extended the storyline to include the lives of John Adam's sons, grandsons and great grandsons and their contributions to history. The acting and sets on the Chronicles were poor soap opera quality with simplistic scenes and studio settings without the background music and detail or acting quality in the John Adams miniseries... but it is worthwhile for viewing the additional details about the Adam's family.Normally, when you see a book where the contents are copied from another author, screenwriter or production... it is called, Plagiarism. I could not believe my eyes as I watched ""The Adams Chronicles"". McCullough's 2001 book biography of John Adams was nearly word for word the same as ""The Adams Chronicles."" It is apparent that the Pulitzer committee had not seen the 1976 PBS production either.I don't know how I managed to miss this PBS series when it aired in 1976. This was the first time I had seen it. McCullough's book is just a verbatim copy of that 1976 series. As I said, this book by McCullough is nearly word for word from that 1976 PBS series... and definitely not worthy of a Pulitzer prize in writing skill... not to mention the copying of nearly the entire content from the PBS series. I was stunned when I saw it. I wonder what the Pulitzer committee would think if they watched this 1976 Adams Chronicles series? I did not know this series existed and only found it by accident while I was looking for additional info on John Adams. You can purchase ""The Adams Chronicles"" on Amazon.I do recommend watching the HBO production, ""John Adams"" since it is a clear masterpiece of screenwriting, award-winning acting by the entire cast, fantastic visual scenery and excellent direction. Even the soundtrack music is superb. Even if you do not care for history, I highly recommend this series. You will love it.McCullough's book does have additional info about John Adam's childhood, but nearly every word of his book can be viewed on the 1976 production, ""The Adams Chronicles."" If you are interested in more about the life of John Adams and his family, The Adams Chronicles contains all of the details... but the acting is flat and overdone at frequent points and has no soundtrack to speak of... but it does have all of the missing historical data.If you watch both miniseries of John Adams and the Adams Chronicles before reading this book from McCullough, you will be sorely disappointed with the juvenile quality of writing, disorganized material and timeline jumping... not to mention the word for word copying ""Verbatim"" of the details from the 1976 production. This looks like the definition of plagiarism to me... Perhaps the Pulitzer committee should watch the 1976 PBS series, ""The Adams Chronicles"" and compare it to McCullough's book on John Adams. I found the comparison quite disturbing.Check it out for yourself. The Adams Chronicles DVD set is sold on Amazon as is McCullough's book, John Adams as well as the HBO miniseries, ""John Adams"". I recommend all three and you can do your own comparison as to the verbatim wording between McCullough's book and the 1976 PBS series. The HBO production of, ""John Adams"" is a must if you have not seen it. An excellent production and you won't regret it. You can also obtain this book as an audio book in CD format. Be sure to choose the ""unabridged"" version to ensure it contains the full, text.",['David McCullough'],['Biography & Autobiography']

But I was really disappointed with BNW, supposedly the fifth greatest modern novel. The science-talk was too bulky and lengthy and very little of it contributed to the story. The characters failed to capture my interest, leaving me totally apathetic toward them and their trials. Their catchphrases (&quot;Oh, Ford!&quot; and the many subconsciously-learned rhymes especially) were important to the characterizations but became very annoying after a while. At times the quality of the text dropped notably, well below anything I'd consider to be of any literary value. Often at these points the characters, events, and time periods involved became very difficult to discern. The plot was interesting but stretched to its absolute limits, laboriously squeezing every last drop out of the concept. Since this is required reading for high school seniors, I had no choice. Had free will been involved, I would have put this away after the first twenty-five pages or so. I don't understand why this work is acclaimed at all, never mind so highly.

Even though Aldous Huxley, the author, was very in-depth with all the matters of this ""brave new world"", Huxley, seeming intentionally to make the affairs of these characters public. Showing that this frail society of inventors, in Freud's world of perfection, was in-fact defect and a result of a greater problem with themselves at the very heart of the situation.The characters, by design, are with out a doubt shallow, and find it hard to maintain a singular deep relationship with anyone but him or herself! Furthermore, this novel is plainly a disgust to read. If not finding it a pleasure to read, but how about for ridicule among those whom read it? To think that a society, like this one, could be thought as having any type of perfection is insane. This particular Utopian society is a jumbling mess. Perhaps the idea for this story is to place the image in our minds eye that at any given moment societal views could be skewed.Upon the reminiscing of all the information compiled into this one book, I find that Shakespeare would have something to say about this particular concept of thinking. Besides, he is a key element to the later part of this book however; I do credit Huxley for his creativeness in this venture. Seemingly fearless to write on such a topic, un-avoiding the possibility for a fueled debate on such a matter. The courage one must have in attempting to elaborate on such a confrontational issue is bold alone in itself. He deserves the praise of a true literary marvel. Huxley has a masterful mind, challenging those who might revolt to such literature. I have a feeling that this novel will continue to bring controversy to the market even in the twenty-first century as it did in the thirties, and the interest of all whom may read it. This novel is a drug, like soma, that keeps you coming back for more, no matter how much you dislike the book. It becomes very addicting.I have read the online responses time and time again for A Brave New World and it still baffles me why some think a perfect world, with happy people, sterile and having test-tubing, daily drugs to numb pain and more is any way logical whatsoever.

It is a frightening presentation, precisely because it does not seem improbable.""Only a large-scale popular movement toward decentralization and self-help can arrest the present tendency toward statism,"" writes Huxley in his foreword to ""Brave New World."" No such movement has materialized or succeeded, and so this novel remains a poignant warning even today. A sense of entitlement and reliance on the government-as-saviour still reigns supreme in the Western democracies. ""A really efficient totalitarian state,"" warns Huxley, ""would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude.""Huxley's writing is not particularly impressive of itself; he has no special flowery gift when it comes to use of the English language, but he tells a mesmerizing story.

B0006AM3SG,"Brave new world,: A novel",,A2S244KFX0745K,Alan Edward Creager,10/29,1.0,1268265600,Definitely not one of my favorites.,"Before I begin- there are some epically epic spoilers up in here, so do not read it without taking due notice of what it contains.In short- beware the spoilers.Brave New World is a dreary, pessimistic, disappointing book. It focuses on a discontent man, Bernard Marx, in a world where everyone is content, a man who asks questions and does things that are not socially acceptable, yet in the end, he does nothing.In Brave New World, set in the year 632 After Ford (2540 in our world) almost all of the human population of Earth lives under a system known as the world state, which uses a tightly controlled caste system, predestination for each individual, and brings up children in ways that can only be described as brainwashing. The only ones who live outside the control of the World State are groups of 'savages', living in reservation areas like Mexico- or New Mexico, whatever- and the Falkland Islands. I started to hate this book and the society it contains in a scene early in the book, in which infants are presented with books and flowers, and are given non-lethal but nonetheless very painful doses of electricity when they take a positive interest in them.This book presents us with a world that makes me cringe with horror every time I turn a page. A drug called soma takes you on a mental vacation, making you happy- why bother fixing your problems when you can just get high?- people are born in hatcheries, mother and father are dirty words, Sigmund Freud is Jesus, and Henry Ford is God.I seriously doubt that Henry Ford had ever intended for the world to look like this. The man was ignorant and probably egotistical in some ways, but few men have ever been so madly obsessed with power and their own ego as to seek to replace God with their own name. It may not have even been Ford's idea, but he still served as an inspiration to the wrong kind of people.But back to our, um, hero, Bernard Marx, an Alpha who is not as happy with the current system as everyone else. He doesn't spend every minute of the day in a group of people, and he doesn't sleep with every woman in town. He also uses soma much less frequently. He even goes to a village in New Mexico to see the so-called 'savages' himself, bringing back John the Savage, son of his boss, the Director of Hatcheries, causing him to resign out of shame and humiliation. I would not call Bernard Marx a hero- he has some of the makings of a hero in the story, especially in a work of dystopian fiction; he feels out of place, asks questions, and God or, um, Ford forbid, he even *thinks*. But what else does he do? In a nutshell, he acts on his unhappiness, goes to New Mexico, brings back a savage, makes his boss resign, and lives the high life until John and subsequently society reject him for the corrupt, repulsive fellow he is. What kind of hero is that?Fahrenheit 451, a much better book with a similar featured government and main character, ends with the main character, Guy Montag, escaping the city he lives in and joining a group of people who have entire books memorized, keeping those books safe until the extremely anti-intellectual government is overthrown, and seeing it attacked and destroyed by foreign aircraft with nuclear weapons. Guy Montag, in short, does exactly what Bernard Marx should have done but did not and could not, and the government in Fahrenheit 451 meets the very end that the World State in Brave New World deserved to.But no.The book ends with John the Savage hanging himself after whipping himself and the woman he has become attracted to, and the people of London and myself were briefly united in standing there at the end, wondering just what the point was and why any of it mattered. I cannot think of when I have disliked the overall story and ending of a book more.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']
B0006AM3SG,"Brave new world,: A novel",,A2CA5PFA66RYK9,B. Mink,1/1,3.0,1273190400,My least favorite dystopian novel,"I wholeheartedly agree that Brave New World is an important book -- I just can't stand it. The satire is thin, the extrapolations from the trends which Huxley observed in his time are too plain, and none of the characters are even remotely likable. The combination of childlike persons and the heavy emphasis of their sexual activities turned my stomach.The Soviet Union with its planned economy and society was clearly one of the big inspirations for Huxley, and if so, he completely misunderstood it. Of course, in hindsight it's much easier to see that communism is just another form or brutal dictatorship that never was meant to do anything else but maximize the power in the hands of a few and to enslave everyone else, yet I think that Huxley should have seen this also. I think that George Orwell was a much keener observer of this fact. Indeed my biggest problem with the novel is that I disagree with Huxley's vision of totalitarianism. I cannot imagine a dictatorship that 1) is not based on an aristocracy that (either openly or covertly) enslaves and brutalizes those beneath them and 2) does not deal swiftly and brutally with its dissenters. Huxley's world is run by World Controllers, who plan and command everything, yet who genuinely seem to be concerned about making people happy (even if this means they have to make sure that a large number of people are born as cretins, and if they have to drug everyone in society) even at the cost of sacrificing their own happiness. If some of the intelligent ones actually start questioning the system, this regime just ships them off to a remote island of their choice, to be with similar-minded people. At one point the all-powerful Mustapha Mond openly envies those who get to go to the island. This is where the book finally and completely lost me. It has been said that ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"", and this is why I find Orwell's and Bradbury's dystopias far more believable than Huxley's.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

Huxley creates a dystopic society where peace and stability are maintained because humanity has used technology to do away with ideas and feelings like love, family, religion, and individuality. There are no books. All members of society are genetically engineered to be satisfied with whatever pre-ordained position they will hold in this society. If anyone starts to have a feeling other than complete satisfaction, they are encouraged to drug themselves with soma for few hours while the feeling passes.

Humans are made at certain genetic intelligence and caste; they are conditioned to be grateful for their place in life. Of course humans being humans there are occasionally those who divert from the norm. The story focuses mainly on Bernard Marx, an Alpha who is born too short, and as such ostracized and isolated in a society based on community and on Lenina a woman who is a fairly average society girl who agrees to travel with Bernard to Reservation. At the reservation they meet a Savage named John who travels back with them to ""proper"" society. What ensues is basically disaster.The kind of creepy thing is that Huxley is pretty spot on about some of the things in his Utopian society. There is a lot genetic engineering going on, subliminal messaging, regulated drug use to promote serenity, etc. The beginning of the book is the most shocking because they explain how they modify the chemical make up of the fetuses to make them smart or stupid, strong or weak. This is followed by a discussion of how they condition the infants to like or not like certain things based on what function they will have in society. It is a society where everyone is equal but no one gets to make any decisions.The people in the society are encouraged to be somewhat infantile in their decisions; time not working is spend playing games or engaging in sexual activity. Despite the society being depicted as somewhat British the members are encouraged to give into their baser natures whenever they want...emotion makes for unhappy people so it is best to not think about it too much.What happens when John, a Savage raised by a (gasp) mother, a man who loves and hurts is brought into this society is fascinating but predictable. He has a hard time making sense of a society where ""mother"" is an indecent word and love is a foreign concept.The book is very readable and well-written. The story is engaging. I am sure at the time this book was written it was ground-breaking. Unfortunately most of the factors of society that are discussed in this book I have read discussed in more current books. For me what set this book apart from other dystopians was the fact that it was written so long ago, also the fact that Huxley didn't pull any punches on the human conditioning...they are pretty ruthless, and lastly how reasonable he makes the set-up of such a society sound. There is a portion towards the end of the book where the Controller explains to John how their society evolved to what it is today; the Controller explains what they tried and what actually worked. The Controller's argument sounds disturbingly reasonable and almost makes you understand how a society set-up like the one in this book might work out well for a large amount of people.Overall I enjoyed the book and I am glad I read it. None of the ideas really blew me away and the story was engaging, but not absolutely incredible. It is a book that makes you think; especially when think of the time frame in which it was written. The topics discussed are something which will make you take pause but some of the ideas presented aren't that far away from where we are today (genetic engineering, etc.).

This world seems to operate efficiently and smoothly until an outsider, an anomaly is introduced into the system.

The human's physical longings such as the attraction to the opposite sex, and also the human communication doesn't longer matter in this new world that Huxley creates.The novel opens at Central London Hatching Conditioning Centre factory, where the director and Hatchery is giving a tour to a group of children who are learning about the society in which they live in and how it is the way it is. Within the tour the boys discover that this factory isn't a normal factory, this factory creates human embryos for the World State. This embryos are categorized in five different castes called Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. Each castes are trained to obtain a certain role within the society, such as leadership or menial labor but one characteristic each castles posses, is the loss of real human emotions, attachments, intellectually, and the ability for self reasoning.This World State is located in London and its the new world, everything outside of it is considered savage reservations, one man named Bernard Marx who is seen as one of the leaders in this new World State questions his own beliefs about the society in which he lives in, which forces him to take a trip to one of the savage reservation in New Mexico, this is where he encounters the protagonist, john. John is considered to be normal within the world that we live in today, he has the ability to reason, choose beliefs, resist sexually desires and to be his own person, a real human being.Bernard Marx takes John out of the savage reservation and into this World State,once John arrives he starts to realize that this World State is utopia on earth, the World State civilization is controlled by soma (soma is a chemical spry that takes away the humanly emotions, such as fear, sadness, pain, hurt, everything that makes us human). The ability to be intelligent no longer exists in this civilization. ""Christianity without tears--that's what soma"" is.Within the world State John struggles to live and understand this new society and the means to be free, to be a human being, to long for real danger, goodness, and the ability to express real emotions such as tears and happiness.In my life the only thing that makes me human is the ability to be hurt, sad, afraid, excited, and weary; this are my emotions. Without emotions I would not be able to fall in love, enjoy books or movies, or anything that makes life wroth living.

They throw you right into the story without much explanation or background. This gives the book an appealing aspect but also makes it confusing to read.If you are planning on reading this book you should know that there is some very challenging vocabulary. These words would make it very challenging to read this book at a young age.But overall I think this is an awesome book if you are in the mood for a dystopian adventure.,['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

I have a 40min. drive to work, so I started revisiting some classics on audio to listen to on the way to work. Michael York does a great job of reading this book. I'm a little confused at why most of the main characters have Scottish accents when they are from London, but maybe York's fantasy is that by the time the book takes place, the Scots have dominated the U.K. There is a part in the begining when Huxley jumps back and forth between characters and settings line by line. I don't remember having trouble following the logic when reading, but it was a little difficult to keep up while listening. Otherwise, the novel works well as an audio book.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

It depicts a future society where there is no natural reproduction with children having a mom and dad. Instead people come from laboratories and are conditioned for their different castes. On top of this, people do not read literature such as Shakespeare. Anything done by oneself is discouraged (with the exception of taking a drug called Soma). For some people who are more outgoing, this society might sound like a paradise. For people like myself who prefer to not go clubbin' with their friends and instead like to stay home and read a book, the society depicted in ""A Brave New World"" is hell on Earth.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']
B0006AM3SG,"Brave new world,: A novel",,AJV28GBR3KH5B,Minnie Nguyen,0/0,3.0,1333497600,Brave New World Characterization.,"Brave New World Book Review by Benjamin CastilloAldous Huxley's Brave New World is a depiction of how the future will be like from his view point. Even though the future may not be how he describes it to be, where everything is being controlled by the government, the book still has timeless themes. One main idea is that there is no such thing as perfect happiness or a utopian society. Another is the relationship between stability versus individuality. Through his use of interesting characters and creative solutions, Huxley is able to carry out and explain the themes well.One theme that personally stood out to me is stability versus individuality. The New World is a society based on technology, where Ford, representing their god, is worshipped. Ford symbolizes technology and the sense of everybody working together. The people are all created in labs and are conditioned to be in a certain class. The citizens only know about and want to be in the specific class that they were born into. This allows for stability among the people since they are happy with their lives. The people are conditioned to do the job they are assigned to and to never go against the government. Lenina, one of Huxely's well-developed characters, is a prime example of this. However, there are still some ""bad eggs"" in the ""perfect society,"" such as Bernard. He is a top Alpha. Alphas are supposed to be handsome, tall, and loved by everyone, but Bernard doesn't fit the Alpha mold. So he seeks the approval of others. Bernard's desire to fit into his society shows that individuality is not welcome in this society.Similar to Bernard, John is also seen as an outsider from the New World. His individuality comes from his past. He is from the Savage Reservation, where an ancient tribal group lives. They still believe in natural birth and believe in ancient religious and spiritual rituals. But John's mom is from the New World. Thus, John has parts from both worlds. He was introduced into the New World by Bernard and was used as an example of what not to be. He was seen by the New World society like a circus animal. John initially loved the New World, but then became disgusted by it. He came to the New World thinking that it's the best place ever. John thought that he would be accepted in the New World since everybody there loves each other and are happy. But once he got there, he saw that the people didn't have the same values or beliefs that he had gotten from the Savage Reservation, which were monogamy and morality. So he couldn't live the way he wanted to because it wouldn't have been accepted. So once again, individuality is disallowed in the New World for the purpose of stability.The New World society and government has to be uniformed in order for it to be stable and work well. Individuality loses against stability because it shows that if you try to show your individuality, you will be attacked for it. Thus, individuality does not work for the New World society. Our society also witnesses the same struggle between stability and individuality. Jails, retiring homes, and mental asylums are some ways we separate ""abnormal"" people. One can always try to who one's individuality, but society might not always approve of it.Huxley has great ideas and shows them well throughout the book. It is an overall good book, but I would recommend it more for the science fiction demographic. The book has a lot of specific terms that requires readers to have some background knowledge in science and technology in order for them to understand the story well. However, the book still has themes that our world deals with and therefore, it is worth the read.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

Although he was criticized nonstop in his time by his peers, today this novel is seen as it was supposed to be seen back in 1932. To begin with, this novel is supposed to represent a Utopia, a perfect world if you will. Happiness is wide spread, and people are broken down into categories. Alpha-plus, Alpha-minus, Beta-plus, Beta-minus, so on and so on, Greek letter after Greek letter. But, because of severe, extra severe conditioning, they like the jobs they work in, and wouldn't be happy anywhere else. Sex, and public sexual experiences are as common as soma usage. No one really cares what anyone else does, sexually atleast. They have also soma. Soma is a hallucinagene times 20, and it effects the body very little, and soma is legal. Often in this novel people take &quot;Soma-holidays&quot;, which is a bit of eternity and bliss in 6 or 12 hours. The conditioning starts before the babies are even out of the test tube, and it works very good. Bernard Marx is the first main character that we run into, some other major players are Lenina, John (The Savage), and William Helmholtz. Unlike most books, this one has no main character, there is 3 main players in this novel, and it changes back to each regularly. Bernard Marx is a hypocrite pretty much, he says something and does another. It is said that alcohol was put into his blood-surrogate on accident, because of his stunted growth, and his surreal ideas.Well, there is a lot more that I could write, but then you would get no surprises. You will enjoy this book, and I know views on this book vary widely, and I'm sure one stars on this book have some good points just like 5 stars. It depends on your mindset, and what you believe in. This novel will make you think, and I know that I will reread it in the future. &quot;Brave New World&quot; was written by a very open minded author, and if you read his other novels you will see just how open minded. Amazon gives a good deal on the book, so, if you can then I suggest you buy it here.

Although he was criticized nonstop in his time by his peers, today this novel is seen as it was supposed to be seen back in 1932. To begin with, this novel is supposed to represent a Utopia, a perfect world if you will. Happiness is wide spread, and people are broken down into categories. Alpha-plus, Alpha-minus, Beta-plus, Beta-minus, so on and so on, Greek letter after Greek letter. But, because of severe, extra severe conditioning, they like the jobs they work in, and wouldn't be happy anywhere else. Sex, and public sexual experiences are as common as soma usage. No one really cares what anyone else does, sexually atleast. They have also soma. Soma is a hallucinagene times 20, and it effects the body very little, and soma is legal. Often in this novel people take &quot;Soma-holidays&quot;, which is a bit of eternity and bliss in 6 or 12 hours. The conditioning starts before the babies are even out of the test tube, and it works very good. Bernard Marx is the first main character that we run into, some other major players are Lenina, John (The Savage), and William Helmholtz. Unlike most books, this one has no main character, there is 3 main players in this novel, and it changes back to each regularly. Bernard Marx is a hypocrite pretty much, he says something and does another. It is said that alcohol was put into his blood-surrogate on accident, because of his stunted growth, and his surreal ideas.Well, there is a lot more that I could write, but then you would get no surprises. You will enjoy this book, and I know views on this book vary widely, and I'm sure one stars on this book have some good points just like 5 stars. It depends on your mindset, and what you believe in. This novel will make you think, and I know that I will reread it in the future. &quot;Brave New World&quot; was written by a very open minded author, and if you read his other novels you will see just how open minded. Amazon gives a good deal on the book, so, if you can then I suggest you buy it here.

B0006AR016,Brave New World,,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""",1/1,5.0,1132358400,Nightmare Paradise,"British author Aldous Huxley's 1930's science fiction novel, Brave New World, has become a classic and required reading for most high schools and colleges. Its timeless appeal lies in the shocking parallel between this fictional futuristic dystopia and our own society today! Yes, this novel is prophetic and if we are not careful we might easily and unconsciously become immersed in a society such as the one Huxley describes. In this world, humanity has lost its humanity. Natural pro-creation and the forming of families has been replaced by decanted babies (in a frightening similarity to cloning). Each person is assigned a station in life from the inferior Alphas to the lowly Zetas. Religion has been overthrown and it is the Ford production line (so valuable in the 20th century and its fast growing car industry) that is being worshipped in bizarre, sexual rituals. People are encouraged to have tons of meaningless sex and live a life of hedonistic pleasures. People are constantly drugged up by the powerful ""feel-good"" drug Soma, which Huxley took from the ancient Hindu drug/drink that the gods loved to consume. Huxley himself would experiment with drugs for a higher consciousness and he would later write about this in his novel ""Doors of Perception"". The characters, some of them stronger than others, are all victims of this deceptively Utopian society. Bernard Marx a lower-caste man is in love with Lenina, a beautiful upper-caste woman who rejects him. Bernard was given alcohol in his blood surrogate and is consequently shorter in stature than the men of his caste. Although originally Bernard hoped he could change the world and seek meaning through all the artifice and shallow existence. Lenina lives in a blissful stupor and conformity, constantly repeating, parrot-like, all the brainwashing ditties that the world society created. The character of the bastard son of the Decanting Room Director, a Native American named John the Savage, is the true hero in the novel, though he, too, meets with a tragic fate. Enamored of Shakespeare, he longs to suffer and feel passions and emotions like the characters in Shakespeare's tragedies. He gets it all right. He falls hopelessly in love with Lenina, but when Lenina begins to get physical with him, he rejects her. He is appalled at the morally crumbling society around him. Finally, he engages in a frenzied orgy and hangs himself in a lighthouse. The world Huxley paints is not pretty, even if outwardly it's a hedonist's dream. Music is always playing, there is pornographic films as mainstream movies and drugs and sex. But it's a world that has lost all its values.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

We ended up eating snakes, toads, insects and anything we could steal or terrorize from boys scout and National Guardsmen on training exercises. We also disintegrated into tribal savages like Golding describes in the Lord of the Flies. Between these interludes in the woods with the boy savages, I read this book (around age 10) and found it jibed with my reality. The words of the Lord of the Flies struck deep into me, for I knew that darkness well. Some believe the book overladen with &quot;humans are evil&quot; symbolism.

B0006AU8K6,Lord of the Flies,,,,0/0,4.0,891302400,I liked it!,"I have read William Golding's book Lord of the Flies. The book is about a group of boys who try to survive on a isolated island after a plane-crash. It is interesting so see the relationships between the boys, how they immediately take up different positions. At their fist meeting one boy, Jack, is chosen as the leader. Rules are made and accepted by every one. In the beginning everything was organized. Young and old boys are working together and everything is fine. But then their friendship begins to fail. One boy who they call Piggy becomes the outsider. Another boy who's name is Jack, who from the beginning also wanted to be the leader, starts to take over more and more. One day the group splits up and Jack forms his own group with completely different rules. Nothing is working on the island anymore and it runs out of control. One night something terrible happens, and it's then when Ralph understands that it's only the beginning. The rules which they all decided from the beginning don't exist any longer. Then Ralph becomes alone, against everyone else...I thought the book was kind of good, but not as good as I had expected it to be, because it's so popular. It is written with describing sentences that makes it easy to imagine the environment and how they think. The language is easy to understand, since the author writes as the children think. But yet the text is deep and the book made me think. The subject that Golding has chosen is unusual, but good. It doesn't only tell us about the boys on the island, but wants to show that power isn't only a positive thing and can lead to something else, much worse.From Karin, 15 years",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

The description of the &quot;BEAST&quot; is very hard to understand...was there one or not? Some parts of the plot, (it was so hard to see where everything was going) were long and irrelevant to the story, such as the long, dragged out descriptions of the island itself.

Last year, the Dixie Chicks educated us all about international foreign policy and military strategy. This spring, Michael Moore shared with us his vision of Saddam's Iraq as a tranquil paradise where children flew kites in the sunshine until President Bush lied to us so he could kill them all and then go golfing.And now, John O'Neill has revealed to us what really happened during John Kerry's all expenses paid vacation in the Viet Cong infested Mekong Delta. Apparently unaware that he was a liberal anti-war coward and communist sympathizer, young John Kerry volunteered for two tours of duty in Southeast Asia. Oddly, the author doesn't count Kerry's first Vietnam tour of duty on the USS Gridley in the South China Sea as legitimate experience for a potential commander-in-chief, apparently because it wasn't as dangerous as George W. Bush's National Guard encounters with wobbly barstools in every tavern between Texas and Georgia.As part of Richard Nixon's ""secret plan"" to end the Vietnam War, American Swiftboat crews were sent into the rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta to provide daily target practice for the Viet Cong. This author seems convinced that ordering Swiftboats to get shot full of holes from point blank range on a daily basis was a war-winning strategy, and the lynch party he has gathered to crucify John Kerry in this book for telling the truth about such mindless folly are not patriots, they are vengeful cretins.The suspense builds as we discover that John Kerry's combat tour as a Swiftboat commander featured unique personal tactics. According to the author, Kerry was rarely threatened by enemy fire, so he developed the habit of slightly wounding himself with a grenade, a flare gun, or any other lethal weapon within reach in order to get started on his Purple Heart collection.In classic Baghdad Bob style, the author infers that Kerry's bungling self-inflicted wounds won him his medals and proclaims that Kerry ""shot a kid in the back"" to win his Silver Star. Ignoring US Navy documented records and the eyewitness accounts of the direct participants in these medal winning actions, O'Neill disputes their validity and merit, as well as the validity and merit of Kerry's Bronze Star award by relying upon the opinions of other veterans.According to the author, we're supposed to believe these other veterans because 60 of them won Purple Hearts and many of them were officers. For those of us keeping score at home, some of their wounds may have just been scratches, but the author never questions the validity of their medals or wounds, only the validity of John Kerry's medals or wounds. Instead of believing John Kerry, all of the men on his Swiftboats, Admiral Zumwalt, and contemporary US Navy records, the author relies upon the memories of conservative veterans who resent John Kerry for personal or political reasons.The right wingers will love this book because it indulges their fantasy that all conservatives are honest, heroic patriots and all liberals are lying, anti-war traitors who hate America. But as far as I'm concerned, people like John O'Neill and Ann Colter on the right, and Michael Moore and the Dixie Chicks on the left, bring shame and dishonor on us all with their mindless, destructive, divisive propaganda.",['BusinessNews Publishing'],['Political Science']

""Claiming detachment need not raise the issue of objectivity. It is a waste of breath to point out that every observer is in some way biased."" (Barzun)Come on folks! Knock knock, anyone home? There are too many respectable, highly decorated, hard working, and loyal Americans pouring their hearts out in this book. The political, racial and economic spectrum is well represented in the accounts. The men and women are leaders, coming from firm roots and strong moral authority. I find it extremely difficult to discredit them. They deserve the deepest respect as war heroes. They earned it!I have never seen so much hatred leveled towards an American President in my lifetime. Lincoln and Roosevelt had no exit strategies in their moments of crisis. We are a nation at war. I am convinced that our beloved President George W. Bush has protected all Americans by taking the fight to the enemy and doing his best to keep all of us safe.In contrast, I open-mindedly reviewed Fahrenheit 911 and found many inconsistencies. Apparently, Bush spent a few minutes maintaining his composure in front of a national audience contemplating an appropriate response to the terrorist attacks while Kerry spent an hour in idle and numb disbelief. I can splice and dice the facts also. Regrettably, people sucked it up like a `super-sized' candy bar.This book is about character, integrity and values. Read the stories of war heroes and judge for yourself. Decades after the Vietnam War, ghosts are coming back to haunt us all. In a sense this is a revival for most of us who are honorable and noble. Senator Kerry represents all the reasons illustrated in the book for why Americans simply cannot support him.May I suggest reading ""From Dawn to Decadence"" by Jacques Barzun, sold by Amazon, for an incredible vision for America.",['BusinessNews Publishing'],['Political Science']

It was as if covey typed a list of 7 things he could do to be more productive, and then elaborated them for a few hundred pages. When he mentioned a group of students from Harvard university having a embarrassing and heated argument over a popular optical illusion( of the young women and the old hag)as if they had never seen it,""almost everyone who saw the young womens face on the card, saw the young women in the image""""whats the matter with you, are you blind? i'd like to take her out, shes lovely""I immediately wanted to burn the book, that's not in any way remotely like any of the students i know. It is my opinion that this did not happen. You may extract your own inference, but young successful men do not quiver over meaningless pictures.Covey's book is a literary waste of paper, his attempt in creating a ""bible"" of productivity leaves him to fill much of his book with ""refer to habit 1"", ""remember the win/win principle"" In my opinion, those readers who Covey successfully lures into his imaginary world of success and victory, win/win, private and public victory, will be disappointed in the long run. I bought the book because i was tempted to know what ""highly effective people"" do, such as sleeping 8 hours or having certain study habits based on how memory works etc, but was disappointed by his advice of, ""beginning with and end in mind"", and ""Put first things first"", which is another term for common sense. Beyond this, covey complicates his 7 habits by putting them in a large graph of a multitude of categories, each category consisting of a combination of the 7 habits.Covey attempts to produce meaning out of thin air, such as his concept of synergy, win/win, and especially ""seek first to understand, then to be understood"".

There are some that need reinforcement or an in depth explanation of what they've been taught. For example, rule #2 Begin With The End in Mind goes in depth explaining an instance where Covey's son was being selfish with his toys and how Stephen Covey allowed him to be possessive of his toys so that he can mold his son into the person that he should be instead of reprimanding him and only making sure that he's a good child.The 'Seven Habits' has become a reference guide for me. He discusses the attitude of abundance versus the attitude of scarcity which could serve as a reminder for even some successful people. Each of the seven rules are useful as a motto for life, but, do not be fooled, there is profound incite hidden behind the seemingly simple, common sense of the 'Seven Habits'",['Stephen R.

The book had quite am impact on me, and upon sharing what I learned with my friends and colleagues, I found that many of them had already read and adopted the habits mentioned in the book. I regret that they had not turned me on to this book earlier, as I am now attempting to work my way through the rest of Covey's works.Other than the citation of a quote from the author of ""On Becoming a Leader,"" my version of the book did not include the word ""leader"" anywhere on the cover, or even in the initial pages, but it is clear that leadership is exactly what this book teaches. Initially I was sceptical that a book focusing on only seven habits could remain fresh and relevant for the 350 page duration, but it kept me engaged and I felt that I was growing and learning throughout. While at times the subject matter did come off as commonsensical, they were admittedly concepts that I had not thought of or applied explicitly to growth as a leader. This, combined with the straightforward manner in which Covey presented the material, made it clear and understandable. I believe that I underwent the ""paradigm shift"" that Cover discusses early in the work.Many of the suggestions in the book are, if you'll forgive the seeming contradiction, as subtle as they are drastic. For example, Covey uses ""Seek first to understand"" (Habit #5) to bring about the point of empathic listening, which is contradictory to the human norm of simply waiting for rush in and reply. This is not a change that would be noticeable externally, but that would result in drastic differences in conversation and over a period of time. Also, Covey has a great use of italics throughout the book. This is usually used when directly referencing his aforementioned habits, reinforcing the previously stated ideas and adding new and clarifying concepts. This kept me engaged and reading with a purpose, truly making the thesis of the given section remain on in the forefront of the readers' thoughts.For me, the addition of drawings, graphs, and charts throughout the book clarified ideas and gave visual representation to what were, up until that point, intangible concepts. The book does not use these visuals excessively or have them interrupt the flow of the text, but they are used when needed, and this was a welcome bonus.Overall, I am happy that I stumbled upon this book for a class, and I wish that it was suggested to me earlier. Totally worth a read, hopefully it will help you as much as it helped me. Let your paradigm shift begin!",['Stephen R. Covey'],['Character']

This book is obviously more than just a boy meets girl who is married to another boy book, but it is not much more. Sure, it raises interesting issues of consumerism and 1920's post war culture, but it never sets its heart on it. It touches it half heartedly, but it doesn't attack it like it should.

Fitzgerlad is too busy telling the story which happenes to be dull and unexciting at the most.The plot, the storyline, the story, and the execution of it is just poor. It's boring. It's futile. It's dumb. I fail to understand why Fitzgerald chose to use Nick, this incredibly dull and uninteresting character, as his narrator when he could have written it third person, or used a more interesting character for the narrator. Even the conversation and dialogue is quite useless. Take this for a sampler, ""I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...or wait a minute- it's ust the opposite- the sun's getting colder every year."" And this quote comes from nowhere and has to do with nothing.Gatsby was obviously drunk, or smoking marijuana when he was writing this book, and must have thougth that this book was pretty clever.

The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book: It lacks depth of any significance. The descriptions are minimally imaginative, and never spark excitement. And the characters? The characterizations, the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions, are all simple and don't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling. Supposedly, for example, the several main characters in the book, most notably Gatsby, have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips, but are afraid to grasp it. But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short, this book, while having a decent plot and overall structure, was boring, because the writing is boring.

Jacobsen ""I am not young enough to know ev...",0/0,4.0,1360886400,Well-written....a Lost Generation soap opera,"With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)",['F.

Golding wrote his book with young readers in mind--the very sort that would enjoy action, and adventure. And perhaps more so young male readers as his experiences of children and their behavior are from a boy's school playground.Some reviews have the effrontery to suggest that this Nobel prize winner adjust his style to accomodate their laziness. To that I say... Nuts! The ignorance is in proportion to the self-righteousness of the young critics who are prompted by their teachers to write such tripe. And there is no shortage of opinionated critics who haven't made the least effort to try to understand the book or attempt to read authorially or for that matter examine themselves in a critical light.At least have the curiousity to find out more. There are plenty of smart readers within easy reach. If nothing else, read the Coles Notes, York Notes or any critical guide for that matter to get a sense of how much one can get from reading and re-reading this book. Is it really cheating if you do it responsibly? And by the way, there is a purpose to the book's detailed (what some impatiently call the ""boring"" and ""long-winded"") scene descriptions. Find out what critics say.The beauty of the novel (the writing, that is) lies in the poetic descriptions that we are offered. Some reviewers talk about the ""realistic"" flavor that Golding brings to the story. Far from being ""realistic"" I see these scenes as having a dream-like and timelessness about them. When Simon lies in a trance in his hiding place near the clearing, watching the butterflies above the tall grass, there is a sense that time has stopped. Human time has little significance on the island. Watching butterflies may be ""realistic""; but the full value of the scene comes through the words which form the less-real images in our reading minds. They are vivid, but being ""realistic"" is hardly the point of the scenes. Experience is. A very new, strange, unusual feel to our lives. Isn't this the value of writing literately? Not to offer realistic images of ""real"" life but to offer unspoken, often unthought but very much felt experience and sensation. Anyway, the butterfly scene connects to another one, where some of the littl'uns are playing at the edge of the beach. The narrator offers up images of distant shores and time and the movement of rock and sediment. The sheer scale of cosmic time compared to the puny activities of the children (pooping, hunting, fighting, squabbling) is breathtaking. The narrator treats us to poetic visions--what some reviewers lumpishly call ""all that long-winded description."" To cut scenes like this out would be like reducing a poem to some prosaic ""message"" and claiming that it all ""boils down to the same thing"". Such nonsense.A teacher's chestnut for this novel (judging from some of the reviews) is to have a trial to wind things up. I cringe when I hear this. What young readers are being asked to do is assign blame and re-establish a moral order that Golding puts precisely in question throughout his novel.

The boys are on an airplane heading for sanctuary from the war, but their ship crashes and the boys are deserted alone on an island in the middle of nowhere without any adults. The children plan to set up their own government to rule them. They believe they can create the perfect civilized government on their own. One of the boys even comments; &quot;We're not savages, we're British&quot;But the boys soon give into their animalist urges of hunger and fear and turn into reck-looses and savages in the name of survivial.This story is perfect social commentary.Also like the children becoming savages with out parents to guide them; its an example of how humanity becomes animals without a God. As suggested by the very title of the book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;; which is a biblical name for Satan (Beelzabub -Mt.10:25;12:24,26/Lk. 11:15/ Mk.3:22)This book is a clear example of what happens when people worship the god of the earth by give into their animal instincts and choose to ignore the God the father.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about. The book is around 150 pages, which is strange, seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page. Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find, the characters make me equally angry. I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me, but these children are just unimaginably dense throughout the story. They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader. What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that? People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism, but I'm just not seeing it, just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion, society, etc. Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level, the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous. If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot, and not describing the children and scenery, he may have had a half-decent story on his hands. If someone is looking for a decent book about survival, try &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, at least he made it interesting to read.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students, I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore, when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies, I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end, if you look at it from another point of view, things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies, I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages. What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind. His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes. I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy. The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot. The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it. This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know. Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

It made me wonder with which camp they would align themselves: Jack's or Ralph's. The frightening realization is that there are so many bullies out there aged 12 and younger who would probably turn out just like Jack or Roger if left to their own devices. I shudder to think of how right Golding was in his theory that man is easily swayed by fun and immediate gratification, and that remorse and compassion are considered weak and disdainful emotions. This book will be lost on the young reader, who lack the understanding of the use of metaphor and symbolism. Viewing a rendition of the island while reading the story provides a helpful guide through Golding's description of it. A couple Web sites to see maps are homework-online.com and gerenser.com. Don't read the character or story analyses until you've read the book, though, or you'll spoil the impact of the story, but definitely read them after you've finished the book.

The book is about how a group of children got deserted on an untrodden island and how they try to survive and get rescued. Children probably would not like the horror, but the book is suitable for teens and adults. Golding used many devices including symbolism and he also didn't finish the book completely, which let the readers choose what will happen to the boys. He ended the book with a guard finding Ralph and a few little ones while Jack and his crew was still missing. I didn't like the end of the book or the symbolism because I don't adjust well with these aspects.Even though it was a fantastic book, I thought some of the scenes were disgusting. For instance, some of the descriptions of the pig, Simon, and Piggy's deaths were gruesome. Golding used descriptive words to make you imagine what was going on. When those events were about to happen, Golding used foreshadowing. The story is so unpredictable and suspenseful that readers are on the edge of their seat. Golding wrote amazingly with not many boring and slow parts. However, there are a few confusing parts in the story that are complicated to understand. Overall, Golding did a great job rewriting the story with a different twist from the book that started it all - Coral Island. In fact, this is one of the best novels that I ever read.

I understand that William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegorical examination of the inherent depravity of the human condition. I get Golding's depressing message that man is a nihilistic savage, when left to his own devices. I understand that Ralph represents civilization, order, and decency (the alleged ""grown-up world""); Piggy represents common sense and the rule of law; and Jack aggression, chaos. . .evil. I totally get the symbolism of a group of boys (innocence) on a remote island sans adult supervision completely devolving into anarchy.Yet I had several problems with this 20th Century ""classic."" The characters were one-dimensional paper cutouts; the dialogue confusing and hard to follow; the description of the island's terrain downright confusing (creepers?). Yet my biggest problem concerned the fundamental, bottom line question: How did the boys get on the island?Yes, I understand that in order for the story to be told we must have a group of boys dropped randomly on a deserted island. The story, of course, develops from there. We are given vague hints that the boys arrived via plane crash--but that presents even more questions that are never, ever, answered. If Golding is going to ask me, the reader, to suspend disbelief and follow his story, he's got to give me more information; otherwise, I'm already holding his tale at arm's length. (Pardon the pun.) Here are my problems--never addressed:If there was a plane crash, where is the wreckage? The fuselage?As the story progresses, the boys' clothing becomes tattered and torn until all of the children are virtually naked. Was there no luggage on the plane?Other than the pilot, were there no adults on the plane? Were none of the boys injured? Are we being asked to believe there was a plane crash whereby all the adults were killed and all of the boys walked away with nary a scratch?All the boys on the flight were schoolboys, but other than Jack and his choir members the rest of the children were total strangers to one another. How can this be?Alas, all of the above made reading this novel a most difficult and unrewarding experience.

I first read it to familiarize myself with the text in order to better assist a student I was tutoring. Since its publication in 1954 readers and scholars have found it to be a perfect subject for infinite speculation and theorizing as to its philosophical and allegorical underpinnings. But even apart from theory, Lord of the Flies is a marvelous novel for its attention to pure story. My recent re-reading of the text revealed Golding's real gift as a writer is in revealing tone, voice, emotion, and character.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

B0007C4L2Y,Lord of the flies: A novel,,,,1/1,5.0,1209600000,Jacob's Book Review,"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, narrates a story of a group of boys trying to survive after their plane crashes on a deserted island. After the crash, a boy named Ralph and a boy named Piggy come together and use a conch shell to send out a noise to alert the other boys to come and meet them. A tribe of mixed ages is formed by their efforts, and the little ones of the tribe starts seeing a beast during the night. Shortly after the sighting of the beast, the tribe kills their first pig. While the tribe is busy killing the pig, however, the signal fire goes out and a ship passes by. Between the pig and the fire and the beast, the tribe has too many disagreements and splits into two clashing tribes.This book is about a test of will and leadership of the boys because there is no guiding or advice for the boys to follow. This is a study of how some people might come together and bond while others will become enemies with no one to rely on for help or friendship. Somehow, against all odds, the boys survive for a period of time. This book is definitely worth reading and would be perfect for kids between the ages of ten and twelve who like adventure stories. The author is very descriptive and uses intimate details to describe the setting, but also writes in a classic style with some words or sentences that are added unnecessarily. The character's emotions and thoughts are described very well and it feels like they have realistic troubles and ideas. The book has a very interesting and exciting plot that incorporates the characters and the setting very well. The dialogue is also very realistic and interesting. This book is a great read that will never be forgotten.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

Davis ""Care Bear""",1/1,5.0,1210809600,Who needs Rowling when you've got Golding?,"LORD OF THE FLIES, by William Golding, is one of the best books to come along in literature since Chaucer and his CANTERBURY TALES. Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it ""boring and stupid,"" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and ""too many big words."" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked ""more blood and guts."" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES.

B0007C4L2Y,Lord of the flies: A novel,,A6CZ0IU29MSV6,Walker Brewer,1/1,4.0,1241308800,Human Instincts for Dummies,"Many books try to show the essence of human emotion and feelings. Another common theme is to show the innocence of children in a world of adults. William Golding's Lord of the Flies Golding finds the true balance of the innocence of children with human instinct when it's thrown into the midst of the jungle.In Lord of the Flies, the reader is placed into the world of children as they are stranded on an island. In a world without order, the kids have to rule themselves and make their own law. Soon the strongest of the pack come out and rule the weak-hearted. If a child disobeys the higher power, they get punished the sentence of death.The characters of Piggy, Jack, Ralph, and Simon are characters that everyone can relate to. They all express different human emotions that are inside of all of us. From the strong leader Ralph who leads the children, to Simon who is the boy who could lead the children in a peaceful and productive way of life.Many people say that there is too much symbolism and not enough on the story. I don't agree with this because the symbolism is what makes the book so powerful and lasting. Symbolism is something everyone can relate too and makes the reader think.Golding's goal to show children breaking down into basic human nature works perfectly in this story because all the characters feel real. He makes the characters crash so much that they feel like normal kids but, they still have animal characteristics like the urge to kill that make the kids so complex. He also makes the characters likable and more believable without overdoing it.To Sum it all up, I love the characters and the symbolism in the story. The Characters are well developed and have depth which is nice to get once and a while and the symbolism makes the reader think about human nature and emotions. The weakness I see is that it takes a while to get into but, if the reader continues to go through the story and stick with it, the reader will find the story fun and endearing. Personally, it made me think about life and how at the worst of times people become monsters and do not listen to themselves.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

This is one of those books that I would use sparknotes to find the connections if you're not reading this for a class.

I don't live in the South, but that is the only big difference. In fact, my e-mail nickname with my friends is Scout. I do have a friend like Dill. His name is David and we mainly see each other over the summer. My favorite part is when she has the whole ordeal with Francis. I also like the part when Scout says to Atticus, &quot;Atticus, you defend niggers?&quot; and Atticus replys, &quot;Don't say nigger, it's commom....&quot; The two people who put that the book sucks and it's boring on the book reviw, I hope you see the light",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']

You really didnt know what it was going to be about, except that prejudice would play a big part in the plot. As the book progressed I started to like Scout(one of the main charcters). She had a very strong-will for her age, and matured alot by the end. Her father Atticus defended a black man-Tom Robinson during this period of racial hatred(the great depression). The book taught me about how people were in this county at that period of time, and showed the theme of initation, and standing up for what you believe.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']
B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,,,1/2,5.0,1083628800,To Kill A Mockingbird = Great Book,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a story about two juveniles that face trouble that is at work all around the U.S. racism. Jem and Scout Finch are in a position where their farther must defend an African American by the name of Tom Robinson. Tom had been accused of raping a white girl. As Harper Lee expresses the strong prejudice in the 1930's.The story takes place in the southern part of the U.S.A. in a county called Maycomb. There Jem and Scout and their friend, Dill, play. Though Dill only stays for the summer with a lady named Miss Rachael. Miss Rachael along with Miss Maudie, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and others of wisdom all live in the oldest neighborhood in Maycomb . Lee describes the wisdom of the neighbor. ""Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood ain't it? Been Here Longer than the town""(Lee 103).The Finch family has been put under a lot of pressure over Atticus's job defending Tom in court. The family even seems to turn on them. Though Scout acts in the wrong way towards this pressure. ""Francis [Scout's cousin] looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued, and crooned softly, ""Nigger-lover..."" This time I had split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth"" (Lee 96). Lee describes Scout punishing her cousin for calling her farther names.The most peculiar part of this book is the way Jem, Dill, and, Scout treat there neighbor, Mr. Arthur Radley as if he is a scary and crazy man. They later found out he was quit fond of them and watched and helped them more than they knew he had. He wasn't evil just shy. ""Mister Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. That's right, sir."" I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm. He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie was watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down the sidewalk as any gentleman would do""(Lee 320).I highly recommend this book to all readers. There are several lessons in this book that will help you in life. I also am impressed by how the narrator is a young girl instead of a middle-aged person. That is just the coolest way to write, through the child's eyes. So please, do read this book you wont regret it.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']

B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,A2EF2GK0U8JVYZ,Nikki Zimmer,1/2,4.0,1084924800,To Kill A Mockingbird,"I enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird. Not only was this novel immediately interesting, but it taught important lessons about life. One of those lessons, was overcoming racism. Throughout the novel Tom Robinson is the obvious example of racism, but less obvious, is the treatmeant of Boo Radley. Boo is not treated poorly because of his skin color, but because he is considered an &quot;outkast&quot;. Throughout the novel Scout has to learn to recognize racism, and to realize that society's views of people are not always correct. A quote that shows Scout being taught this is found in Chapter 3 on page 33, when Atticus states &quot;You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.&quot;Another major roll in this novel was the developing innocence of the children. Throughout the novel we are viewing Scout's morals developing into a more &quot;grown-up&quot; point of view. At first, Scout plays games with her brother Jem and neighbor Dill, mocking the Radleys. However, as the novel progresses, she starts to think of Boo Radley as a human being, instead of a form of entertainment.Another roll in this novel was played by scoical standings. The importance of social standings constantlt understand the ignorance of the townspeople. I believe that the quote said by Atticus in Chapter 10 page 109, &quot;Remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird,&quot; shows that Atticus wants his children to understand that people should be given their privacy, and not discussed throughout the town because of their short comings.Other than the lessons in this book, another great aspect of it is the setting. The town is introduced in Chapter 1 on page 2, as &quot;An old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it.&quot; I believe that this quote was the perfect way to describe Maycomb. It shows that at first, the town is innocent, like Scout, but also foreshadows that the town, and Scout will develope into a more comlex exisctence. Anoher important part of this book was the characters. The characters were well developed and were very complex. I felt like the Finches were a real life family, one that I could truly understand, and one that over the course of the novel I actually grew to care about.If you enjoyed reading To Kill A Mockingbird, then I would recommend the book I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, by Maya Angelou. The plot about racism is similar and the styles of writing are equally intriguing.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']
B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,A3H8YWT4IJPP94,Alex Sato,2/3,5.0,1085616000,Now I know why it's a classic,"When my mother first recommended Harper Lee?s To Kill a Mockingbird to me, I was quite reluctant to read it. I had tried once before, but I was impatient with it, and the story seemed slow. All the plot consists of is a girl and her brother in a slow-moving southern town. Boring, I thought to myself.Interestingly, now that I have actually focused on the book, it is one of the most thought-provoking books that I have read. It is not about incredible quest and danger, sorcery and knights, or massive wars. In fact, it is a story about young girl?s small ventures, which in perspective are great adventures and challenges. Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with interesting and colorful intricacy. she tells her many tales with a viewpoint that cannot be replicated by an adult. Attempting to catch a glimpse of the infamous maniac, Boo Radely, with her brother Jem and summertime cohort Dill becomes a great mission with twisted plans. Consulting her all-knowing father Atticus turns into conferring with a great wise man. All this woven into her attempts to understand the stubbornness and prejudice of the adult world makes for a wonderfully deep story.All through the book, what at first seems like a slow plot evolves into a simple yet intriguing plot that will keep you reading. Though probably not a book for those who don?t read a lot, specifically kids, it definitely will catch the eyes and trigger the mind of most avid readers. A great book, strongly recommended.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']
B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,A3VCIEUL8UBE61,Hana Kikuchi,2/3,5.0,1085702400,Will Always Be a Classic,"To Kill a Mockingbird is a brilliant novel, portraying the intricacies of Southern life during the early 1900s. The plotline, consisting of the experiences of a eight-year-old girl, Scout, and her family, seems so simple, yet Harper Lee creates a much deeper understanding of love and hate.Describing the events from the viewpoint of a young girl made the story much more fascinating because adults and even teenagers forget how innocent and pure a child's mind is. Although fictional, this story was so realistic and honest in Southern ways, and I realized that that's how life really was back then: harsh and unforgiving.

B0007DRGI4,To kill a mockingbird,,,,1/2,5.0,1086652800,To Kill a Mockingbird,"To Kill a Mockingbird is definitely one of my all time favorite books. It teaches everyone a great lesson about being prejudice to other people of a different race. It shows that even kids like Scout and Jem are aware of these issues and can be bigger people about the issue than some adults. They also face other hardships in their life other than prejudice. Scout is always being pressured into being lady like and not to play with the boys and what they do. That is not what Scout is like though, she likes she be with her brother and his friend and do what he wants do to. She doesn't like to be with other girls have tea parties. She is one very unique girl. I can relate to her in this way, because nobody wants to be girly all the time. Sometimes you have to be different from other people. Nobody wants to sit up straight all the time and be nice and pretty. Being different isn't bad all the time. Both Jem and Scout have to deal with having no mother and living with only their father and their caretaker. They are very different characters but that is what makes them so interesting. This book has a clear lesson, that we should treat every person with the same amount of respect. We shouldn't treat people of a different race differently. They are the same on the inside as everybody else. I think if you're looking for a good book to read this would be the one to choose.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']

Deangelis ""blueshadow""",2/3,5.0,1088294400,Harper Lee is the 20th Century Mark Twain,"I read this book shortly after it was was first published. I was a teenager and liked it well enough, but it made no great impression upon me. I was more moved by the film it inspired. Thirty years later I reread the book and was amazed at how much I missed, what a wonderfully subtle, understated, humorous, and hardbreakingly humane book this is! Even more astonishing to me was my retrospective realization that this book was decades ahead of its time. Its treatments of class, race, gender, sexual abuse of children, and religious hypocrisy embody a level of sophistication that, I suspect, those who lionized the book upon its publication did not fully understand. The film based upon the novel, for all its merit, fails in many respects to take seriously Lee's incisive treatment of these subjects -- indeed, it trivialized much of it. Harper Lee writes like a dream. She wastes almost no effort. Her desciptions of the town of Maycomb, Alabama (the fictitious location of the novel's plots and subplots), its folk and folklore are always engaging and well constructed. More important, they lay bare the hidden, ugly realities of history and class-structure that shape the life of the town. Like Mark Twain at his best, Harper Lee refuses to let her painful recognition of human ugliness in all its forms turn into bitterness. It is always tempered by her humor and humanity. True, she refuses to accept injustice and cruelty, especially those codified into the fabric of social life. Still, the wonder of this novel is the even more important refusal it embodies: the refusal to hate those whose blindness contributes to and perpetuates those forms of injustice and cruelty. Lee's decision to employ the innocent perspective of a bright, fiesty, motherless young girl helps to keep the novel's tone from being strident and accusatory. The author, in her wisdom, prefers to gently awaken her reader to a deeper appreciation of the difficulties and importance of acting decently in an imperfect world.",['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']

The story is based in southern America and is portrayed through a young girl's eyes. Atticus is a widowed lawyer and has two children Jem and Scout (narrator). This book shows what it's like to grow up as a kid in 1930's Alambama and how they deal with racism as children.Harper Lee takes you into the world of racism and clearly gives you images on how life was back in the 1930's. She gives you a mixture of personalities in her characters and also a rollercoster of emotions.The book is one of it's kind and I highly recommend you buy it and have a read.I give this book 10 out of 10 and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.,['Harper Lee'],['Fiction']

Rand's literary style is on a par with Jackie Collins: overheated melodrama, strong masculine hero, simpering female heroine (whose casual acceptance of her rape as Howard Roark's perogative as a man of ego is horrifyingly offensive), and lots...of...breathless...ellipses. All of which makes for a long, boring read. Philosophically, Rand's Objectivism has holes in it big enough to drive a Communist May Day Parade through. For example, if the ego is the most important aspect of a man's life, and altruism is one of the great negatives, what would she say about altruism for egotistical motives? I don't think Ted Turner is giving all that money to the United Nations simply for humanitarian purposes - otherwise, he would have been horrified at the magazine covers and long articles praising him. I read on the Ayn Rand institute's web site that she is looking for &quot;men of intellect.&quot; Men of intellect would cringe at the oversimplifications rampant in &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; which might explain why so many high school students, whose intellect is still forming, like this book so much. The only reason that this book doesn't get a lower rating is that &quot;We the Living&quot; is so much worse.

I have just re-read it at age 30, and liked it even more than 4 years ago. Contrary to what some 1 and 2 reviewers say, it does have artistic merit, but to enjoy it you need to accept the fact that it's incurably Romantic. It's rather black and white (even so, not as nearly as much as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;) and her heroes are people as they should be, not as they are. If you can only accept a character that has the same weaknesses as you do and can't deal with an idealistic character with no weaknesses, you will not like this book. I got from it the feeling and appreciation of the incredible beauty man is capable of creating and living, and the uplift you get from watching a strong person laugh in the face of adversity and winning. It's unreal? So what? You see what's possible and worth trying to attain. I think the best way to describe &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a quote from the book itself: &quot;...a sense of joy. Not a placid joy. A difficult, demanding kind of joy. The kind that makes one feel as if it were an achievement to experience it.

I viewed them more as characterizations of specific traits, and the technique (assuming it was intended) heightened my enjoyment of the novel.Others have waxed poetic about the long, self-serving, drawn out passages. This is also true, but numerous authors of classics employ the same technique. Who, for instance, could claim that the writing of Thomas Hardy is not a disgraceful example of butchered English? Nonetheless, his literature is still valued for its depth and meaning.I like the novels. They inspire me, they motivate me, and, yes, they give me sanction to be the self-centered human that I am.

Besides changing the lives of untold thousands of people, this book is my candidate for the greatest novel ever written. The only challenge, in my humble opinion, comes from its older, big sister, Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; which belongs in a class of its own: mythical novel; philosophical treatise; blueprint to societal collapse.In &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; one witnesses the heroic struggle of Howard Roark as his vision of life triumphs over the anti-life forces that would &quot;Iron Heel&quot; him to a spiritual death. The theme here is the individual spirit soaring through life, in love with creation and the act of living.&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a masterpiece, integrating theme and plot; characterization; and writing craftsmenship together in one tightly wrapped story that will remain in the hearts and minds of the American culture as the Mt. Rushmore of a New Age.This book was originally rejected twelve times by major publishing houses. Quite recently, Modern Library, under the auspices of its editorial board, choose the 100 most important novels of our time.

Some day people will look back at this -- as we look back at those who rejected the printing press, the car, the airplane, and the computer -- and laugh at the folly of those so blind.People just don't like this book; they fall in love with it. This is a great book to give as a gift to a loved one, for what better gift could one give a person, than the gift of their own life.

At first I was rooting for him, but when he experienced one defeat after another and didn't seem to care, I stopped caring, too. I actually found the villians more interesting than the hero, for the most part. Peter was interesting, and it was interesting to read about his rise and what he did to achieve it. Toohey was interesting at first, but after his big speech to Peter he descended into cartoonish supervillainy. The only character I really liked was the sculptor, who was admirable but, unlike Howard, actually seemed human. I realize that Rand was trying to create a portrait of her ideal man with Howard, rather than a realistic person, and that this ideal man would probably require equally unrealistic supporting characters and enemies, but I felt the characters were so unrealilistic as to be mostly uninteresting.

Look at the content and framework of her work, not her life. She was a narcissist, but she was also one of the most brilliant women to have ever lived.

I read the first page of this book while bored at a yard sale, and was immediately hooked. Rand's character introductions are excellent, and immediately give picture to the character. This is especially important because for the most part, her characters each represent a personality type consistent with a particular aspect of her philosopy.What I believe unique about this book is the singular challenge Rand had in crafting a novel that can stand on it's own as a story (it can), while each page advances the specific set of philosophical, political and economic positions that are the true reason the book was written. I imagine that other writers have sat down to write ""the novel"" deep within them, with major philosophical themes providing dramatic tension. Other writers, wanting to advance their own complex philosophy, would simply write a non-fiction book presenting themselves as gurus of this ""new"" way of thinking (whole sections of bookstores are full of such books). Rand's courage to attempt to write a great novel that is in fact a primer for Objectivism, and her skill in doing so is what makes The Fountainhead the achievement it is.Now, why only three stars? A couple of reasons. First, although her story arcs are superior, her paragraph by paragraph writing is often heavy handed, and beats her points to death. Secondly, the length and scope of some of the philosophical speeches given by her characters, particularly in the last quarter of the book, are simply not believable. Employing other writing techniques could have achieved this more believably. It's as if Rand hasn't trusted her own characters to carry the point she put them in the book to illustrate. The speeches do however, make their points crystal clear, especially Toohey's speech about collectivism. It's just that you don't believe Toohey would have made that speech, to that person, in that setting.I said at the beginning that it makes no sense to separate the story from the philosophy, and though I know I am now criticizing the philosophy and not the writing, here goes. If I read this correctly, Rand's ""ideal man"" is entirely self focused, does nothing he doesn't want to do regardless of anyone else's need, does everything he wants to do regardless of how it might effect others, places himself above the rule of law, commits several felonies, watches virtually everyone around him self destruct and leaves the novel entirely self satisfied. Rand calls this the ""ideal man"". Others might read the same book and identify Roark as a sociopath, just a very talented one who also possesses many admirable qualities. By the way, on a factual point, the idea of Roark being acquitted after admitting the deed in open court is ludicrous.Wasn't it Shakespeare who told us ""To thine own self be true""? The notion of being your own man, and standing on principle is as old as philosophy itself, but Rand has given it entirely fresh treatment and perspective.One last note- my wife was reading ""Atlas Shrugged"" at the same time I was reading ""The Fountainhead"". It took until I was nearly finished to notice that there are no children in the book. None of the main characters are raising the next generation of ideal men. I asked my wife about ""Atlas Shrugged"", and she said the same. I wonder if this isn't the fatal flaw of Objectivism- can you be true to Objectivism and be a good parent? Or raise a family? Or preserve a marriage where ""the two shall become one""? Her two major novels show that her characters can't, and a glimpse around you might show that the ""me"" generation isn't doing such a good job either.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

Since then I read it five more times, and the first few times I enjoyed it nearly as much, but after that the veneer wore off.This is not because it is shallow as some claim, (i can read Wodehouse over and over) or because it is bad writing, but I think because her premises are just wrong.I still think this is a good book about a creative person's struggle, and a refreshing counter to socialism, but as I have gotten older, better read, I find her ideas as destrucitve as the collectivism she purports to have hated.And you really can't discuss this book without discussing her ideas, as the philosophy plays a central role to the plot. In reading her further, I found her radical atheism and indifferance to nature disturbing and as destructive as collectivism (as her discples are proving to be)There are some interesting, exciting parts- and her descriptions of how bad art becomes popular are probably uncannily correct.If there is one thing to take away from this book it is the determination of an architect (howard roark) to not comprimise his principles and creative vision.

B0007HUT02,"The fountainhead,",,A1CYRTQ04LYI55,"therosen ""therosen""",8/9,5.0,1103760000,Howard Roark as Rand's ideal person,"Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's novel introducing the world to her powerful concept of objectivism. The protagonist is Howard Roark, the ideal objectivist man, who holds himself to standards above those commonly held by society. He avails himself against medicority in the form of outdated schools, petty peers who get by purely on social skills, and a socialst organization bent on proving that everyone really is equal.There are three criticisms frequently made against the novel:1) The characters are one dimensional, lacking depth. To this I respond that Rand writes in the Romantic tradition, preferring extreme characters (whom we should strive to become) to clearly dilenate the battle between good and evil, rather than more complicated or in depth characters.2) The positions she takes are too extreme and unrealistic. For this, I suggest looking at the timeframe. It was the 1940s, and the US was just waking up to the horrors of communism. Coming out of the 1930s, the US could have taken a dramatically more socialist turn. As a wake-up call, this book needed to be stark.3) The rape scene is hardly becoming of an ""Ideal"" man. I have no response to this criticism, as it is likely true.Despite being perhaps 400 pages too long, and rather one dimensional, this still ranks as one of the most influential works of our century. Many silicon valley execs praise the self-deterministic beliefs, and even our Fed Chairman is an admirer (though he's backed off many of his more extreme beliefs). If you agree with the precepts, consider it fuel for your fire. If you consider Rand a crackpot cult leader, read it to better understand your enemy.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

Hughes ""poeball""",8/9,5.0,1105747200,One of the dozen or so books that markedly changed my life,"Rarely does one come across a work of such fervid ideological passion. Written on mild amphetamines by a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who saw her family ruined by the Bolsheviks, Rand's immensely successful novel is less an articulation of a specific philosophy (as it is generally advertised) than it is a dramatic attack on Marxist ideas (collectivism, altruism, ""dialectical materialism""). Her celebration of individualism is overranked and her notions of selfishness as a high ideal are misplaced. Perhaps if she defined more strictly selfishness within an aesthetic context, or used the term ""self-centered"" in its place (for selfishness implies a consideration of self to the detriment of others) her argument would be more palatably logical. We might also add that there is altogether too much laughing, smiling, inner knowing, too many speeches that sound the same, too much dialogue that doesn't fit the mouths of its characters, and repetitive, declarative syntax that absolutely CLUNKS. Nevertheless, this is a great novel for its dynamic spirit and its towering archetypal characters, which clash and collide wonderfully about. I first read The Fountainhead when I was eighteen, and in many ways I am still influenced by Howard Roark, the uncompromising architect and hero of this novel (the book ends and begins with his name). Rereading Fountainhead thirty years later I still find it compelling and even motivating. Rand was an atheist, but her God was Art, and her Satan was any system that organized against Art to protect its own mediocrity and power, an observation as fresh today as it was a century ago.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

I started the Fountainhead keeping in mind that since it was written earlier in Ayn Rand's career than Atlas that it probably was going to be less refined, and perhaps less articulate in its philosophies. I was correct. Atlas Shrugged in my opinion is brilliant, and it has assumed a position on the top of my favorite books list. However, Fountainhead i felt was rather boring in comparison, and far less powerful. None of the characters possessed any real charisma that made characters in Atlas Shrugged such as Francisco D'anconia and Hank Rearden so memorable. Fountainhead also lacks any truly poignant scenes, resulting in a mesh of seemingly meaningless events making up the story. Roark's speech at the end in the court case is the only moment that is comparable to the radiant brilliance of Atlas Shrugged, and for the most part is the only piece worth re-reading in the book.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

I thought it was the best book I had ever read - until I read Atlas Shrugged. Even then, with no experience, I understood what Ayn Rand was writing about. Now, as I approach 70, I remember those reads as if I had them memorized, and here is my book report on the first.The Fountainhead is about the war waged by one, Ellsworth Toohey against the soul of the individual. Why he waged such a war, I have never been able to determine. No more have I been able to fathom the choice of crime over hard work. No more the choice of religious terrorism over religious tolerance. No more the atheism which is nothing without God. Better to be counted a Taliban who would NEVER bomb a statue or diminish a woman.Ellsworth is one of the great enigmas of literature. He would rather no progress than to have to produce anything that has calculable value to another. He would be the one who decides what the value is and who will posess the title. Ellsworth is a cheat, a liar, a prevaricator, a manipulator and, because he is all of that, and intelligent, he is Ayn Rand's example of the Great Progressive. His only decent characteristic is that he is not a politician. He is a carp by choice and by literary design.The Fountainhead is fiction, but be certain of one thing. Ellsworth is alive and still working as hard as ever. Sadly, most folks haven't got a clue about that. They don't see him everywhere the way I do. Well, here's the way you can see him as clearly as I. When you meet someone who justifies mediocrity in anything, look carefully, and you will see Ellsworth as himself or in drag. Once you get his message, you will understand and 'objectivise' his universal presence. Ayn Rand wrote about the ease with which the mass of non-geniuses, to which most of us belong, can be led to believe that those with ability are to be channeled into endeavors of value to us. We are led to be social workers rather than engineers by insuring that the least trouble with math during elementary school is an excuse to shunt someone to non-quantitative employment. The bright are separated, because we don't want them to be bored, but they are bored anyway. They do not even have the challenge to help their less able classmates, because they have been isolated in another track. Children are labeled by their academic performance in K-4. Parents lobby for quick advancement for THEIR offspring who are, naturally, the best and the brightest is neither in or for their best interests and futures. Everyone has to have the opportunity to be the best that s/he can be, so everyone goes unprepared. Ellsworth and mediocrity. Those who can analyze Ayn Rand by the power of her character constructs do NOT dare go near her philosophy. Her philosophy is the philosophy of clear, and brutal, honesty. She would rather that the education that has devolved so surely to the medi-ochre, be redesigned, instead, to teach all knowledge to students who may need to measure, divide or imagine, as well as they can learn, by the hands and minds of those who understand the fundamentals of what it is they now only pretend to teach. Of least concern in one's education should be what the teacher thinks. Rather, the measure of a good education is the degree to which a student learns to think with objectivity/clarity and individuality. Ayn Rand is bemoaning the progressive creation of the eternal, unthinking, mob. As fiction, it may have the weakness of too much crystallized truth. As fiction, the strength of The Fountainhead is that Ayn Rand captures us all in her stark characters. She has an agenda, and she presents it in a timeless manner. Why else are folks still calling her names and characterizing her nature rather than discussing her thesis? Her FICTION is not set in any past, nor any future. Her story is set in the now. It is always relevant in the NOW. No less so than when I was 22. If you want to discuss a theory of mine, try the following. There are more communists/socialists in Burbank, CA than in the whole of the Czeck Republic (past CR president) - US versions of the Taliban, too. Don't deny it unless you have evidence to the contrary, such as, are there more male or female mud wrestlers in the USA? And, how many of the Abu Graib miscreants were members of a religious group? My estimate is that most of them would ascribe to the doctrine of the Progressive; yet, in the way of the progressive, it was the political (religious) right that received the enmity of the mob. Even now, the progressive excuse for failure is ""GW"". Ellsworth is everywhere, and Ayn Rand was correct. We have a weakened system of governance, a weakened system of education and a weakened economic system. Current governance depends on the manipulation of the mob. Education creates the mob, and the bankers, the rich, and the religious are to blame for everything. The much more intelligent progressives will come to our rescue again. Oops! I suspect Ayn would strongly suggest that I either end or get back on point. So, my advice is buy it NOW, read it, and screw your head on properly as soon as possible!

I have listened to Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" at least a half dozen times over the past couple of decades. If you know me you'll know that I don't give up the time to do this lightly. ""The Fountainhead"" I found to be somewhat more preachy (yeah, yeah I know. Is that even possible?). Ayn's never really been known for multifaceted and realistic characters, instead they all rather assume aspects of her ideology and remain focused in that manner throughout the book.About halfway through ""The Fountainhead"" I had considered not bothering to finish it (it *is* just under 31 hours long after all) because the characters really are not at all accessible to me. The motivations the characters espouse for their apparently sociopathic behavior toward each other (protagonists and antagonists alike - although which are which is sometimes not really obvious) are absurd to a rational human. They make sense only in Ms. Rand's relatively black and white conception of the world and the values that one needs to hold to be true to themselves within it.But I persevered and was gratified by the way the story wound up finally.I would say that it's worth experiencing this book at least once just to get a sense of Ayn Rand's philosophies.

Some of the time I would wonder why Roark did not just go into a blinding rage and strike everyone who hated him. But I felt connected to him when he was put on trial.

That just goes to show you, you can't ever trust women and their emotions. Keating, on the other hand, knew nothing about his profession, he knew only what other people have shown him and told him.The book kept going between at least five different characters and they each had their own woes and blows, but Ayn Rand knew what she was doing when she wrote this book, she probably researched architecture and business, both the good side and the ugly side. She gives you an okay background on some of the ""main"" characters and an intricate web of past memories for others like Gail Wynand.The obstacles of this book are society and their prejudice.

This will please his legions of diehard fans and attract some new ones. The author drags you into the story rather than grabbing you and the more you read the more hooked you become. Grisham turns his attention to the plight of the homeless and sets the stage in Washington, DC. What is interesting about this theme, the homeless and their problems, is that the plot could realistically be played out in any large city. Our hero is on the fast track to the million-dollar-a-year partnership at a prestigious DC law firm. He and his colleagues get held hostage by a homeless person with a grudge against the firm.... I've read several reviews of this book suggesting the plotline is unrealistic, and I disagree. I step over homeless people regularly on a 4-block walk to work at 6 in the morning. I've seen several of the same faces several times over several years and wonder how they survive. A homeless person with a grudge and some ingenuity just might be able to saunter into a private building without adequate security and threaten life and property, and it could conceivably happen in any large city. The possibility of this scenario lends credibility to the storyline. The only outright criticism I can make is that the book what too short.

The eviction also effects several other poor people who are forced to homelessness when their building is scheduled to be razed to the ground as a future constuction site. The story tells about the reasons behind the evictions and the effect those reasons have on others.One of the many reasons I enjoy reading a John Grisham novel is his ability to describe social issues within the context of an absorbing, provocative story. In &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;, he tackles problems of homelessness and poverty. He challenges the reader's values. When Brock was deciding to quit his high paying position at his reputable law firm, I was hoping he'd be persuaded to give up the idea. When it became evident he had made the committment to serve the less fortunate I admired him greatly and cheered for the plaintiffs in the pending lawsuit.Grisham did a credible job of bringing attention to the problems associated with homelessness. Drug addiction, mental illness, parenting, unemployment are conditions exacerbated by homelessness.The most important insight however, is the awareness that with a few bad breaks homelessness can happen to most anyone.

This one was certainly different from the rest of them in my opinion, in both good and bad ways. On the negative side, it was not as suspenseful and fast-paced as, say The Pelican Brief or The Firm or his other courtroom dramas- when I read them I could scarcely put the book down for fear that something was going to happen between the pages in my absense. However on the positive side, this book contained a much deeper message than those other books did. (Which probably explains why it wasn't all about write-an-awesome-story-to-sell excitement.) The story begins when a bum walks into a rich firm and holds ten attorneys- including some of the best and richest in the firm- hostage in a little room. He has dynamo strapped to his body and is holding a gun. He asks one lawyer to give him the facts straight of the IRS reports: how much money have each of these big-time lawyers donated to charity? By charity he doesn't mean the local symphony or the high-up charities they give money to in order to get their name mentioned, but money given directly to the poor homeless people on the street or the soup kitchens, free clinics, homes, etc. that help them out? Of course the lawyer can't give a very big figure. Although no harm results from this short hostage-holding-session (except to the bum, who is shot by a sniper outside and whose brains explode all over the lawyer who was assisting him with the figures) and it seems like the bum was just trying to make a point instead of really hurt anyone, and although the rest of the attorneys go back to their strenous trying-to-get-on-top schedule, the laywer who was asked to tell the bum the statistics is deeply touched by this episode and wants to find out more.The lawyer's name is Michael Brock, and he becomes the main character of the story. Although he is a rising star at the Drake and Sweeney, the law firm, he gives up some of his billing hours to investigate this incident. This decision leads him to helping at a free clinic and donating his time at a homeless shelter. When he finds out what connection the firm has with the bum, he leaves it, and takes along with him a stolen file. From then on, he is a crook, and a street lawyer.This book wasn't only another good John Grisham tale, but a touching story of a man who realized his life had been shallow and he wanted to make a difference. I recommend it with this reason. If you want a fast-paced court-room drama, read another of his books first.

He quits his current job as a hot-shot lawyer after is encounter and becomes extremely into helping the poor. When he finds out about some wrong-doing at his old law firm, he steals a file that tells all. He thinks he got away with it until he gets into a bad car crash and the file is found by the wrong people. The main character is Michael Brock, who begins the story a lawyer in an unhappy marriage.

He and his wife later separate and he moves into an apartment where he sleeps on the floor in an attempt to relate to his customers. Obviously, the book's title is The Street Lawyer because that is what he becomes. I didn't like this book because it was over-the-top dramatic and preachy. I have never read a book by John Grisham, and I guess I was expecting much more. The ending of the book is the worst part; it simply cuts off on the part that is remotely interesting.

There's no doubt that the profession could and should do more for those who are less fortunate, and I think this book does a good job of putting that into perspective, although it is just a bit preachy. Aside from a somewhat incredible part about a homeless man holding the members of a law firm hostage, it is a believable and forthright look into the world of poverty law and pro-bono work.What I find particularly bothersome and somewhat offensive were the somewhat politically charged opinions of some other readers that this book was a springboard for the author's political views (of which Grisham doesn't appear to have made his readers aware), or that it is written with a &quot;liberal&quot; viewpoint. It's unfair and rather ignorant to refer to anything that attempts to raise social consciousness as &quot;liberal&quot;. This is yet another example of how the dreaded &quot;L&quot; word gets overused these days by self-absorbed, ignorant people who disagree with anything that brings attention to the social problems of this country that they'd prefer we didn't talk about because it reflects their own selfishness and greed.Read the book with your political filter (of whatever persuasion) turned off and enjoy it for what it is.","['John Grisham', 'Michael Dean']",['Fiction']

B0007OXTHU,The Street Lawyer,,AUCISQA1YXX86,Confederate,0/2,4.0,1252281600,Proof Even Than An Attorney Can Change,"Some reviewers find it difficult to believe that a hardened attorney could suddenly sacrifice his wife and promising job to pursue a redemptive job as a street lawyer. Those wedded to money and the gain of the world might have a hard time with the premise; however, life can deal blows that can cause anyone to reexamine their values and priorities (Saul of Tarsus comes to mind). Although Grisham gets preachy every now and again, his story as told through attorney Michael Brock has the conviction of a convert. Whether a person can change that much without having any signs of it beforehand can be debated, but Brock isn't happy. He's simply on a track he thought he wanted on and now he's not so sure. Suddenly his life has purpose and meaning, but can it be fulfilled by being a street lawyer?While reading the book I wondered if perhaps Brock might not have more of an impact by simply giving more of his money away rather than trying to redeem himself in court. That's a valid point and one Brock should have considered, but didn't. Grisham also uses the book as a base of attack against ""Republicans"" (those who take public monies from worthy causes). Had it been written more recently, during the Obama administration, for example, it might have been more balanced as now there would be two extremes: Marxist and Neocon.Again, it's through the eyes of Brock, but Grisham doesn't lose a beat in making his points. In the end, Brock does find redemption and if he's educated some on the plights of the poor, it's even better. People should read the book from that standpoint alone, as we will think a bit differently the next time we pass someone with an outstretched hand.","['John Grisham', 'Michael Dean']",['Fiction']
B0007OXTHU,The Street Lawyer,,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,Bookphile,0/2,3.0,1253059200,Not really a novel,"I've been reading John Grisham for years and have always thought that he doesn't just write entertaining legal thrillers, he is also a pretty good writer. However, I've found that his writing doesn't always hit the mark and I thought that this was especially true of The Street Lawyer. It seems like a book that is searching for an identity.It's ostensibly a work of fiction about a lawyer who has a change of heart after a homeless man holds him hostage in his swanky law firm. This isn't really true, though, as the plot is more of a thin veneer coating what is really a work of nonfiction about the plight of the homeless in the U.S. I don't mean to say that Grisham trying to educate his readers about homelessness is a bad thing--far from it. What doesn't make sense to me is why he set the book up the way he did. I read Grisham's gripping work of non-fiction, The Innocent Man, and I can't help but wonder why he didn't write a similar nonfictional account of homelessness, as it seems Grisham is well-informed and passionate about the subject.I can also see how fiction is a good platform for inspiring readers to think more deeply about important causes. History provides us with many examples of this, such as Uncle Tom's Cabin or The Jungle. However, Grisham doesn't use fiction to great effect here. Most of the story has to do with Mike, who is really more of a symbol than a character. Mike has a great change of heart and comes to see that the world of ease and glitter inhabited by the wealthy butts directly up against a world of struggle and grit inhabited by the less fortunate. There is so little development to him, though, that he could really be any wealthy white male who realizes that, in fact, money really isn't everything. Likewise, when we are introduced to homeless characters like Ruby or Lontae Burton, they are little more than ciphers. The reader is given a very terse synopsis of what led to their homelessness but we never get a feel for who these characters are as people.The novel is ultimately a real disappointment. The premise is very interesting and, had it been handled deftly, could have led to a real page-turner. Aside from the poor character development, there is precious little tension over the cover-up upon which Mike stumbles. This is a device that Grisham has used to great effect in the past and it's a letdown that he falls so short of the mark here. A Time to Kill proved that Grisham can handle controversial topics very well and in a way that really makes the reader think. It's a shame that this book doesn't display that same level of ability.","['John Grisham', 'Michael Dean']",['Fiction']

I can't help but be struck by how simple minded many of the negative comments about the book are. What they don't understand is that the vast majority of people are motivated by the desire to be appreciated. Because we are all so consumed with our own desire to be appreciated we often miss that elementry fact. The principles of this book are simple, but their implications are complex. Therefore, its occasional simplicity could never deminish its greatness. It seems to me that those who hold negative comments about this book felt as though they were being tricked. Remember, Dale teaches that we should communicate &quot;honest, sincere&quot; appreciation and admiration of others. Phoney is phoney whether it is in 1937 or 1997. Dale would never advocate the use of untruths in winning friends. People are not stupid, simply naturally motivated a few common factors. Some readers became defensive believing that they are to smart to fall for these techniques. But, you see, they are caught up in their own sense of selfworth, their own sense of importance. What a shame that the brilliance of the book was lost on them. Other readers had the ability to recognize that they were also motivated by a desire to be appreciated. Those are the readers who have changed the way they see human interaction. Man is a complex animal filled with instinct and the ability to reason. There are certain situations that cause the vast majority of people to react in the same manner- this is instinct. A perfect example is a smile from another. Your first impression of that person is that he is friendly. This thought is involuntary. That fact that we all respond positively to a smile does not mean that we are being tricked. We are simply receiving the nourishment that we crave. Still don't believe me. Imagine this situation honestly. You have always believed that Tom from work is an ass. But yesterday you had a conversation with you best friend from work when the subject of Tom came up. Your friend says to you, &quot;Well, I don't know what you've done to Tom to make him think you are so great, but earlier today he told me that you are the most valuable employee in the company and that your integrity as a human being is unmatched&quot;. What do you think about Tom now? You can't help but to like him can you? I would like him. Why? My new openion of him is involuntary. I think I am important and deserving of recognition just like every other human being on the planet, and he gave me what I craved just like every other human being, honest sincere appreciation.

Why is that?As a management consultant, I am always asking our clients and potential clients what their major issues are. It almost always boils down to persuading someone else to change. In many situations, the person describes the situation as getting worse rather than better.As I ask more questions, I soon learn that the person I am talking to is totally thinking about the issue from her or his perspective, not the perspective of the person they want to influence. Carnegie describes a situation where he and his son couldn't get a calf into the barn. They pushed and pulled, and nothing worked. A maid came out, stuck her finger into the calf's mouth to simulate feeding and the calf followed her right into the barn.As you can tell from that example, Carnegie is a student of the stimulus-response school of human behavior. The book is divided into four sections: Handling People; Getting People to Like You; Getting People to Agree with You; and Being a Leader. Each section is comprised of a few principles, which are each exemplified in a short chapter with a number of examples. Handling people has to do with avoiding the negative and unpleasant, appreciating the other person, and making the other person eager to accomplish some goal of their own.Each section follows the same format. Basically, it's the same way that you train any living being. You provide positive feedback to the person which makes them feel better, the person responds positively to you making you feel better, you then help the other person to link what you want to share with them with something they want.Many people will be offended by this idea. I have long studied that reaction and find that it relates to one of two basic assumptions: (1) the decision to act should be based on the objective merits (if I deal with emotions, I am being manipulative) or (2) I want you to acknowledge that I am right, that you are wrong, and that I am superior to you because I am right. Both of those perspectives get in the way of establishing warm human relationships. If you would rather do things without emotion, your life will be very dull. If you would always like to be right, you will be very lonely (even if you really are right).Let's look at a more fundamental question. Can these techniques be used for questionable purpoes? Probably, is my answer. However, at some point, the person's manipulative game will be found out. See Robert Cialdini's book, Influence, on what happens to smugglers of influence over time.The best results will come from those who have integrity and are principled. They and everyone else can see that they are pursuing something with another person that is in the best interests of that person, and that there are no hidden agendas. Here is where I think Carnegie is a little weak. You get the impression from the book that hidden agendas are okay. My experience is that all agendas should be totally upfront. Don't pretend you are trying to help someone, when all you are trying to do is sell them something they don't need. Do encourage them to get the information they need to make a good decision for themselves about your idea, product, or service. Leave the whole circumstance with a stronger, more trustworthy relationship than you started with. That's how I interpret the Dale Carnegie principles.If you really would like to get better results in your human relationships, this book is essential reading. To skip this book would be like skipping reading and arithmetic in grade school. It contains essential tools that everyone needs to understand. Since these things are seldom taught in schools, this is a good place to start.Modern gurus of human relationships and effectiveness like Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have a substantial debt to Dale Carnegie. If you read all of them, you will tend to reinforce your new habits. I like the Covey and Robbins approaches as a complement to Carnegie, because both authors focus on having principles at the center of what you do. That will help reduce the risk of turning Carnegie into techniques that lead to suboptimal results, instead of a mutually reinforcing virtuous cycle for everyone.Researchers consistently show that success in many fields (such as business, politics, and teaching) is very closely related to one's social skills. Many people will work very hard to be more successful, but skimp on the relationship aspects. That's a mistake. Work on the relationships first.I also recommend Daniel Goleman's &quot;Working with Emotional Intelligence&quot; to understand these concepts and the new book, &quot;NLP Masterclass,&quot; to help you extend these lessons with specific skills.Enjoy having easier interactions with others, having more friends, being more influential on important subjects, being more open to being influenced by others, and leading where it needs doing!After you finish reading this book, think about where you are trying to pull a calf where you want the calf to go.",['Dale Carnegie'],['Self-Help']

I tried this, and I did feel closer to people who talked to me about their personal history, but then logically this must go both ways. If you have said nothing about your own interests to the other person, then how can they feel also close to you? If you have said nothing about yourself then, then you are still just a stranger to them.IT PORTRAYS AN IDEAL WORLD:In real life, I have never met one person who displays all the characteristics mentioned in the book. In the real world, nobody is capable of dealing with humans perfectly all the time.The world is full of brash, assertive people who state their opinions, who do not try to be everybody's friend and do not always sugar-coat the truth. (Hint, they're probably your managers ;-) ). Contrary to what this book says, such people usually have plenty of friends and are very influential and respected.The truth about life, is that you can't avoid unintentionally offending people, as people are affected by so many different things. Some people will never like you, no matter how hard you try. If you doubt this, try sucking up to everyone you meet for the next week, and watch what happens.LYING TO OTHERS:There's a bit in the book about a conversation at a party where a quotation from a book was questioned on its authenticity. Rather than simply tell the truth and actually let the facts be known, it is stated that it is better to keep quiet (passive lying) so as not to let the other person be seen to be wrong!! But what will happen when the other person finds out that they were wrong, and that you had the knowledge to give them the correct answer?Not speaking up about what you know to be the truth is abhorrent, especially on critically important matters. If it offends the other person then that's just the way it has to be. Imagine a doctor not telling a patient he has cancer, because the patient might not like it. Look at what happened with Enron, only when the truth was told were matters finally bought to justice. Hiding other people's critical mistakes is not good, or clever in the long run.ADVOCATES BEING A DOORMAT:Carnegie says, be nice to everyone. In reality there are many times when you need to stand up for your rights because being nice will not solve all matters. For example, if you are being bullied at school or at the workplace you have to assert your rights in every way you can. There are many recent cases of people winning compensation for suffering acts of discrimination at the workplace. These are people who went against Carnegies advice, who would not accept abusive treatment, and stood up for themselves, to a positive result.Many people will blatantly abuse niceness. The truth is, that in the real world of today, too much kindness is taken as a sign of weakness and those who try to win friends and influence people in the way Carnegie recommends, all too often end up used and abused.Carnegies advice has the potential to turn people into passive ""doormats"" who think everyone else is always right, and that they themselves are always wrong. The reality is, that to be effective in human interactions, people need to give their own opinions, and state their own truth, even if it offends others. Effective communicators accept that they will never be friends with everyone. People who behave assertively, who speak up for what they believe in, and do not quietly sit back and let other people walk all over them, blatantly rise to the top in most social situations and ironically have many friends and influence many people. Doormats are notoriously ineffective in winning friends and influencing people.A valuable social skill is asserting yourself. People want to know what you think. They don't want their own words regurgitated and spat back at them by a shallow, sycophantic liar.Think of all the people you know who are assertive and who speak up for their beliefs and their rights. Such people usually have more than enough friends. Ironically, it is the nice person who wants to be everyone's friend, who never seems to have many. The truth is, that people will not automatically hate you just because you state your own opinions, or because you say something contrary to what they are saying.CONCLUSION:There are good things about the book, specifically that people like it when others take time to listen and respect their opinions, but this obviously has to work both ways. This book was probably more useful in the good old days, when it was first published.If you spend your whole life being nice to people and suppressing your own opinions, even when you know full well at times, that it is unjustified, you will regret it. Life does not work that way. There are many, many circumstances in dealing with people, where niceness is not an option. Speak up for yourself and for what you believe in, even if it has the potential to offend others. Abraham Lincoln did, Martin Luther King did, Jesus Christ did, Michael Moore did, etc. I've personally decided that I'm going to live my life by saying what I believe in, and be myself, and take whatever comes to me. Everyone won't like me, but everyone won't hate me either. The real way to win friends and influence people is to respect others where possible, but more importantly to stand up for what you believe is right, and speak up for it.",['Dale Carnegie'],['Self-Help']

It has the charm of an old-fashioned expos&eacute; complete with introductions, examples that illustrate the ideas and boxed-in conclusions. The teacher in me loves it.The book is about developing skills to become an effective communicator. Dale Carnegie obviously has a very deep understanding of human psychology and although the tips sound simple, they are essential. Two recommendations stood out for me. One says that in order to be effective dealing with people, it is important to get interested in others and listen to them from their point of view . The other says it is more effective to praise others for what they do well than to criticize them for what they do poorly or in other words making people wrong and working on them does not work .These two ideas are central to the book Working on Yourself doesn't Work by Ariel and Shya Kane. In this book the authors also show that there is nothing to gain in judging and berating others and ourselves. They suggest that as we develop awareness of how we automatically judge and criticize, an opportunity opens up to transform and access personal power and enlightenment.

Absolutely dated!,"Carnegie's book has been a bestseller for a century. The problem here is: the main argument of this book is absolutely false, wrong and incorrect!Carnegie noticed that many people didn't like to be criticized. And erroneously concluded that all we have to do is:stop criticizing, and he thought that he made the greatest discovery of all time. So he wrote this book and saw himself get rich and famous all around the world. Ok, it wasn't his fault, he didn't have any idea that those people he uses as example were all ""psychopaths"", the worst class of humans. They didn't like to be criticized just because they coudn't discern they were guilt, they didn't feel anything, they didn't have feelings, they coudn't feel because they had, like all psychopaths have, a malfunction (a damage) on their brain's frontal cortex. They have never admited guilt. They have never felt any remorse, simply because they can't!So this book is a complete apology of psychopaths!Nowadays, with specific knowledge modern medicine developed about psychopaths, specialists like Dr. Robert Hare have written that if you have never criticized your son, you can induce a quasi-psychopath behaviour on him, and terrible consequences will be felt by you, and by people with bad luck of crossing his path in this life. Even in professional environment, specialists changed their vision completely, What they considered wrong like criticizing management policies for example , nowadays they've said that criticizing is important to correct wrong decisions on time.I have this book as a relic of the past, but I know that it is completely dated, the main argument is completely wrong and is dangerous to society in general.Obviously we should avoid excesses like criticizing all the time for example, but remember that, all excesses are wrong from the beginning.",['Dale Carnegie'],['Self-Help']

How do you get the best of an argument? Avoid them at all costs, they are not worth the price. Always show respect for others opinions. Never, ever, say ""You are wrong."" This gains you nothing. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. This is biblical from the mouth of Jesus, no less. Begin all encounters with people in a friendly way. Always get the other person saying yes, by finding common ground. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking, this is perceived as having great listening skills. Let the other person feel that the idea that you are presenting is his or hers. This is a skill. It is crucial to honestly see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas to make them unforgettable and convincing. Throw down a challenge, something for the other person to live up to. This appeals to the ego and desire to be important.A leader's job includes changing people's attitudes and behavior. Here is how to be a leader in a nutshell. Always begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly and very discreetly. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face, give them a way out. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement to get results. Make any fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.This is an excellent book within the realm of learning, developing, and using people skills. So many of us lack this level of tact and finesse, most of us would do well to read this book and put its principles into action. I believe all readers will get the money spent on this book back a thousand times over in the value it adds to your life if you put these principles in action and refer back to it before important conversations take place in your life.

Heller structures Catch-22 in a jumble of flashbacks of events and repetitions. Heller may first mention something very random at the beginning of the book, and make it seem like it's some joke. However, then later on in the novel he'll actually tell the situation behind the first mention of it, and it sickens the reader to learn what truly happened. For example, Yossarian, the main character in the book, has a ""dead man"" in his tent. At first this just seems to strengthen the opinion that Yossarian is insane. Heller repeats this use of the ""dead man"" all throughout the book until finally he tells the reader who the ""dead man"" really is. The ""dead man"" is a man named Mudd. Mudd transferred into the same squadron that Yossarian was in, but immediately went on a mission after he put his stuff in Yossarian's tent. He was killed on that mission, but his paperwork hadn't actually transferred him into the squadron. Therefore he was never actually in the squadron. That means his stuff still lies on one of the beds in Yossarian's tent, and no one can take it out because it's really not there. At first the reader may find the mention of the dead man to be humorous, but when the reader finds out the truth they feel disgusted with what they were laughing at. Another structural episode that is repeated numerous times throughout the book, deals with a man named Snowden. At first he is just mentioned, and once again this adds to the thought that Yossarian is insane. Then near the end of the book Heller tells the reader what really happened with Snowden. This graphic description of Snowden's death sickens the reader and once again enforces the purpose of the author to show how horrible war is. Irony also is very prevalent and purposeful in conveying Heller's message from the book. One instance shows how corrupt the management has become. The leaders of the squadron want them to go bomb a bridge to form a roadblock, or that is at least what they tell the men. The truth is they just want to get a nice picture of a ""bomb pattern"". They don't care that this will kill innocent civilians, all they want is their stupid ""bomb pattern"". It is ironic that the commanders don't uphold that decency of not killing people just for the fun of it when they should. They really don't care even if their own men die, just as long as they get some recognition. Another irony demonstrating how war twists things, happens through the chaplain. It says ""the chaplain had sinned, and it was good"". This is ironic because the chaplain is supposed to uphold some sort of righteousness even in trial, and now when he sins it is good. A paradox that also portrays how war really messes people up is the fact that Yossarian thinks that everyone is ""trying to kill him"". At first this statement seems ironic, but the more the reader gets into the book the more truth it has. Not only does the enemy try to shoot Yossarian down, but his own commanders are trying to kill him by making him fly more missions. Colonel Cathcart, the leading colonel of the squadron, keeps raising the number of missions therefore giving more chances to everyone else to kill him. In an indirect way the colonel tries to kill him, and according to Yossarian so is everyone else. War has made him paranoid, and it destroys any sort of faith in goodness or even any kind of truth. War has completely warped everything that he is. Heller's purpose is to show how terrible and twisted war can make a person.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

The author, Joseph Heller, made full use of his extraordinary wit. The whole novel takes on a light view, looking into an American military camp in Italy. The story is superbly set up as a camp of foolish bombardiers headed by egotistical power- and glory-hungry generals.The story shifts from character to character, spending only a few pages on each. As the story progresses, previously introduced characters come in contact with each other, setting up the plot.Heller wrote the book ten years after the war was over, but he still was able to grasp the general ideas of a military camp. Heller realized though that his novel was going to be much too serious if he kept it completely factual, so he changed a few details, which altered the novel from being serious to funny.Although Heller changed the idea of a camp somewhat, he was still able to write an extremely funny novel. His wit provided an amusing storyline that no other book from World War II has, making Catch-22 truly one-of-a-kind.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

I saw my own world changing after reading the novel for two weeks. The way i thought the way i talked, my views on what a coward and what a brave person is.

B000B770YG,Catch 22,,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,bixodoido,0/2,5.0,1058313600,there's always a catch,"Catch-22 is a biting satire about the absurdities of war. Set in World War 2, the novel is about a squadron of bomber crews stationed in Pianosa. The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian. Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22. All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22. This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where ""what's good for the syndicate is good for the country"" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny. The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious. In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?). Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power. By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.This book is a modernist approach to war. The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face. In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the `Catch,' or die trying to escape it. The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character. This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

Joseph Heller munches-up one of our most sacred institutions, the military and spits it back into faces. Through the eyes of Yossarian, the World War II bombardier who wants nothing more than to not die, Heller exposes all that is kitschy, absurd and soul-numbing about not just the US army but about the high-minded American attitude in general. Indeed, this is probably less a novel about warfare, as it is a novel that comments on all American extremes including extreme pride, extreme capitalism and extreme bureaucracy. Heller may be a gadfly and he may be too cute at times (my only significant complaint about his style) but it is undeniable that he often has a point. It is easy to commiserate with Yossarian. Why is the numbskull who commands his regiment any less of an enemy than the numbskull who commands the one on the other side when both could get him killed? What do things like pride and country matter to someone who is dead? What does it all mean in the end? Those are questions for the reader to answer, but it is pretty certain that there is a passage somewhere in Catch-22 that would take a pretty good shot at his or her resolution.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

B000B770YG,Catch 22,,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,Kendal B. Hunter,1/9,3.0,1165795200,This book has only one key flaw!,"""The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite."" G. K Chesterton.*This book's one flaw is that it neglects a discussion of the concentration camps. But more on that later. . . .Catch-22 is classic absurdist literature, focusing on bureaucrat's circular reasoning and double-binds. Although the story set in WWII Italy, anyone who has had to deal with hierarchy and bureaucracy--be it the military, college, the DMV, or the Board of Deacons--will resonates with the ideas expressed herein.It is the American equivalent of ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" In style, Heller is a mixture of Douglas Adams and Dave Berry. He has the same with and the same dead-eye for human foibles, and the cumulative effect of compound incompetence. This is not a ""Greatest Generation""-type book.I found the first third of the book fresh, with the mixture of absurdist and repetitive humor, the stream of thought, and mid-sentence scene changes. Heller's style gives the book not so much a dreamlike feel, but more of a surrealistic flow to the events. It reminds me of the old classic ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.""However, the second third of the book was tedious. The novel humor deteriorated into a gimmick, and a series of stream-of-thought gags. The repetitive humor therefore became redundant. I got the point that things were weird, but the humor-mechanism was overused.The last third got interesting as Heller stopped focusing on absurdist gags, and began focusing on the narrative. This book has a large cast of charters, and it is a fitting tribute to Heller that he keeps track of the mob, and is able to keep us interested in their lives and in the situations.What surprised me the second-most was that this book is definitely a seed-source for M*A*S*H. The most famous moments such as Hawkeye streaking, or his mental breakdown all have their roots in this book. What is that quote about flattery?What surprised me the most was the hidden religious aspect. The book's opening lines are: ""It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him."" The chaplain serves as a pontiff, the unit's bridge between man and God. And Yossarian's relationship with the pontiff is one of love.Brilliantly, Heller drops the subject and goes on with the narrative. However the religious ideas keep cropping up. Chapter 18 has a discussion of God by two atheists. I think the statement by Lt. Scheisskopf's Wife on page 180 is a classic example of someone trying to have their cake and eat it, too. Chapter 25 is devoted to the Chaplain's doubts--which leased me to wonder why Heller wants the character to be this way. Then there is the ironically titled of Chapter 39, ""The Eternal City."" So religion is clearly a leitmotif, but it also serves as book-ends to the story.The story (and Heller's sequel), focuses on Yossarian's and Milo's relationship. Yossarian is the rebel and outsider--even outlaw--of the system, while Milo's assimilates and takes advantage of the system. But as the incident with Snowden and the missing morphine illustrates, the assimilation backfires.So it is the death of a comrade, the unnecessary death due to the war profiteering system, that forces Yossarian to have a change of heart, and reject the sub-word of the black market. This is the essential Christian message of the Atonement.This incident forces Yossarian to shift loyalties from Milo and the conniving Generals to the Chaplain. This is an odd realignment, considering that in Chapter 36, the Chaplain Christically suffers for Yossarian horseplay in signing the letters ""Washington Irving.""Once again, we have these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation. This reminds me of what ex-atheist C. S. Lewis observed, ""A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--`Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous."" (Surprised by Joy).This brings us to the concentration camps. The book's conflict is Yossarian vs. the absurd situation, with the enemy being the omnipresent Catch-22. But Heller does not discuss the nature of Nazism, except for the brief banter in Chapter 42. This omission is the key--the danger of bureaucratism is infinitely smaller compared to the dangers of Nazism. Or Islamofascisms for that matter.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

For those of you that have never run across this law it states, ""If anything can go wrong, it will."" This book seems to embody this thought and nothing else. ""Catch-22"" is a long list of things that go wrong with little hope for meaning or plot. Why is this book popular? I believe that many people can relate to a person that is always faced with problems and is surrounded by strange people. When I was reading this book I was able to find one person (I stress the one) who truly enjoyed it. This single person happened to have been enlisted in the Army twice, both times being put up for Court Martial for their resistance to authority. While hearing this person's story I could tell how their similar situations could draw them to a book like this.

The sometimes witty, often satirical, and always humorous quasi-science-fiction/fantasy story about a young man traveling the galaxy on an involuntary quest for the meaning of existence has managed to survive and remain startlingly current through an entire generation of changes in technology and literary trends.Arthur Dent doesn't have a lot on his mind other than surviving his hangover when he wakes up one morning to find that his house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a bypass. His objections are met with sympathetic indifference by the crew chief until he lies down in the mud in front of the offending bulldozer. What he doesn't realize is that the earth itself has been slated for destruction by the evil Vogons as part of the development of a hyperspatial express route. Moments before the earth disintegrates, Arthur and his secretly alien friend Ford Prefect escape by hitching a ride on one of the Vogon ships, and their journey begins.As Arthur and Ford and the improbable gang of galactic characters they join up with travel from system to system in search of the mythical planet Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer, they are guided by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an e-book that offers such insightful wisdom as ""Don't panic"" and contains articles on subjects such as the importance of towels as well as helpful information about various planets and species. Along the way, Adams hilariously lambasts everything from religion to art to politics to human nature.The story, while mildly entertaining, is not what makes the book work. Rather, Adam's sardonic narration and ultra-dry humor are what make it worth reading. Virtually every page contains at least one description or parodic exposition that makes you want to either laugh out loud or groan.Since the book doesn't have a message or even much of a plot, it might be hard for some to find a reason to read it. But those who enjoy British humor (think Monty Python) or want to see how the destruction of the earth can be so funny may well enjoy it. The good news is, if you really like it, there are four sequels, so you could potentially be laughing for a long time.",['Douglas Adams'],['Science']

Since the Great Depression influences all parts of society, economy and the everday life circumstances are quite difficult for them.Firstly you have to mention that Steinbeck seems to be crazy about details. The very beginning of each chapter is decribed up to the smallest thing consequently the reader gets a good impression where the action takes place. Otherwise his description sometimes seem to be exaggerated and a special background knowlegde is necessary to understand his hidden evidences. Anyways the language Steinbeck's character use is quite pleasant to read if you like American English. Due to this language the character seem to be pretty realistic furthermore it gives the reader a good opportunity to get along with the story in general. Moreover Steinbeck created a lot of different characters, with a lot of different attiudes in addition to that a lot of trouble makes the reader turn to the next page and go on with reading. This mentioned trouble also leads to the end when George kills his best friend Lennie who is retarded. By the way this act compromises also an ethic question.

Kinlock ""Alex the Great""",0/1,4.0,1200009600,'Of Mice and Men' a.k.a. anatomy of the chasms between the human soul and the human dream,"This may be the most rambly review here, but what I can say that I enjoyed this story. The title is borrowed from Robert Burns' most famous poem ""To A Mouse"", and has been alluded to so often in modern culture that it has completely become its own cliche. However, the novel uses this title for a good reason as it tells a story of two people, Lennie and George, who like the poem find that their hopes and dreams will never be realized due to their unforeseen but inevitable future reality. It is very much ahead of its time in depicting laborers at the absolute end of their rope, basically blowing through jobs so much so that they are stuck forever in neutral. If you think about it each character has his own crutch that stunts any growth and which makes each day feel the same, reminding me of Brick's literal crutch later depicted in ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". For example George's crutch is Lenny, a man he so understands and yet so abhors that he goes into each job knowing Lenny's Tourette's like tics and tendencies to clutch things too hard will likely lead to early termination or worse, yet still knows that having Lenny around definitely beats being a nomad alone. Old Man Candy's crutch is old age, as he is someone whom is so disfigured and far gone that even the ownership of his dog is relinquished from him. After you think long and hard about each character, you understand why Steinbeck makes frequent references to animals, because symbolically that IS what all the main characters are to a large extent.The depth of the characters are all fantastic for such a short story, which is amazing when you consider that there are only six chapters and six jumps of scenery/time. In many ways I think that is why a short story like this is more marketable as a book to teach in school than ""Grapes of Wrath"" which tells a more sweeping epic about a famous epoch in history. ""Of Mice and Men"" is easy to imagine, easy to understand contextually, and most importantly deep enough to require speculation about the true underpinnings of the dialogue and the behavior displayed. The dream that Lennie and George had of living of the land was to them almost like a daily vitamin that would get them through it. It would help Lenny believe in a better life, and it would help George feel better about himself for at least offering Lenny moments of peace dreaming about rabbits. I guess I'm different in that I feel that George made up this story and never believes in it ever, ever, EVER coming to fruition until old Candy eavesdrops and offers monetary backing to the dream. George almost uses the story to manipulate Lennie to stay with him and trust him, and in that way I see more ambivalence in his character than most.Of course it is a tragedy, as Lennie relapses thrice (Curley's hand, Slim's pup, and Curley's wife) into what I can only describe as aggressive acts of non-malice. It seems that things that he likes he cares dearly for, he clutches too hard and in order to quiet down their pain from George he increases his vice grips to disfigure what he touches. After his last fatal encounter with Curly's sad wife, Lennie knows he did something wrong again and hides in the spot George tells him to, and has hallucinatory dreams condemning himself for negligence. Luckily he finds George and they both have a deja vu type moment of blissful ignorance before George does what is expected of him, which is to kill him for killing Curley's wife.I guess Steinbeck's main point is to tell us to loook closer before making judgments on a person's character. If given a more isolated point of view, Lennie's character is vulgar and reprehensible. However, his behavior is a result not of personality but of psychological and mental retardation. Much like Candy's dog, who is innocently shot, Lennie is innocently shot because during the time period was a lot less acceptability to the mentally unstable. There simply wasn't enough of an objective back in the '30s to look deeper the inner thinkings of the retarded and regard acts of aggression as more than simple malice. George understands this, which is partly why he is morose all the time in defending Lennie. I also believe that Steinbeck makes sure to give George and Lennie a backstory to prove that George's intentions were mainly good, and that at the end George was giving Lennie as much mercy as possible without turning himself in as a murderer's accomplice. Very interesting for as little pages as it was.",['John Steinbeck'],['California']

I seriously doubt it, but that isn't an invalidation of the present-day issues this book brings attention to.That said, the story is very interesting. I've only read it once, and haven't had any intellectually stimulating discussions on issues it brings up, but the possibility of such discussions gives great value to the book.

What is he preaching with this book? It was obvious he had a point. But I don't think the point is as obvious as we (the people of 2003 - living in a type of Brave New World) assume it to be. It is not condemnation of utopia. That is too blatently obvious throughout the book.I think Huxley was hinting at something more subtle. Perhaps he himself did not understand the answers to the questions he was exploring.Personally, I think that the most interesting issue in Brave New World is the way that Huxley deals with the existence of God and mankind's basic need for a supreme being. Yes, Huxley painted a clearer portrait of the future than even he could have guessed. Yes, Huxley was a master at pointing out the tragic trend of people to distract and amuse themselves without thought, for the purpose of avoiding truth. But - I think that his real emphasis was on that very ""Truth."" Utopias are created because man does not want to acknowledge the need for God. And Huxley's theme alternates between a denial of the need for God(clearly, the God of Christianity) and an acknowledgment that, for every person, some god is essential.An example of Huxley's real emphasis is found in John the Savage and his coming face to face with sacrifice. He wants to redeem himself, give himself up for a greater being - and, in the end, he offers his ""supreme sacrifice."" But John's sacrifice is tainted. He strove to be pure, but he was hindered by an orgy, by soma, by sin that only he knew to be sin. Is Huxley essentially saying, ""There can be no perfect sacrifice""? Is he saying that we beat ourselves up for a nonexistent God only because(like John) we have been conditioned to believe in God? John himself rejected the latter argument in his conversation with the Controller. But at the end of the book, it seems that the Controller turned out right.It is interesting to note that John, in a sense, was a Christ-like figure. Perhaps Huxley intentionally created that similarity.What about John's plea that he must lose himself in something greater...more pure than himself? John tried to make an atonement for himself and he tried to redeem the people around him. He failed to do either.In the end, the ""civilized"" people found greater fulfillment losing themselves in an ""ogie-pogie"" orgy to Ford(their man-made deity)than any fulfillment John ever found in sacrifice and ""trying to be good"" on his own (John's man-made deity was himself).Throughout the book, Huxley seemingly points out the necessity of sacrifice, and of losing oneself in something greater. There are many other references to Christianity in this book. I'm still not exactly sure what Huxley is getting at. Obviously, he is saying there is no real happiness in fulfilling your every lust. But he also seems to be suggesting that neither is there any satisfaction in denying those lusts or giving them up for a greater good.This book made me think. However, I don't think I can swallow Huxley's theory of religion like a blind fish.Huxley asks the question: Where is true fulfillment and happiness found?But he offers no answers.Perhaps the question ought to be: Can we ever find fulfillment of desire and true happiness without knowing God? Or rather, can we know God except through Christ? (John the Savage understood sacrifice and giving himself up for what he thought was god, but he didn't come to God through Christ. He came through Himself and he was a failure.) This core truth of Christianity (Christ's sacrifice for mankind) is the axis upon which spins a world of pleasure-seekers who love to avoid the truth. I think that people can only understand and apply the message of Brave New World when they read it with minds that understand the truth. Huxley (and John the Savage) is right: there is no real fulfillment or satisfaction or pleasure without sacrifice. Neither is there true joy in sacrificing ourselves, with nothing returned to us but pain. But Huxley failed to take it a step further. So did John the Savage.

Platt,0/0,5.0,1068163200,An elegant discussion about freedom and society,"This book is not intended to be a vision of the future, though that is it's fictional setting. Instead it is a story about freedom, or lack of it, about society and our role in it and about conflict between different belief systems. In that regard Huxley does a remarkable job - he uses an interesting story and landscape to provide insight into the human condition in the 20th century and beyond.It is set in a fictional world where people measure time since Ford (as in the motor company's founder) - 360 AF. Ford has become a deity, the founder of modern society through his ideas about manufacturing. Of course the society presented has little or no bearing on Ford's ideas but then hypocrisy looms high in this world. The society is highly structured, it has a caste system dividing people into groups from the Alphas (the thinkers, more individual, highly revered) to the Epsilons (conditioned for no more than menial labor having deliberately stunted development).The conditioning of society is key. Babies are bred, not born. Conditioning starts in the testtube and continues through sleep hypnosis and role play through life. Huxley takes the idea of conditioning too far, in my opinion - I think our genes provide too powerful counterweights to this conditioning but it's easy to accept the idea. Society is controlled by a readily available mood enhancing drug called Soma, by the uniformity of it's people (a process has been developed to cause the development of many many identical children from a single fertilized egg), by mindless pornographic entertainment and freely available sex and by the conditioning allowed.It's here that we find the most interesting parallels - are we using mood enhancing drugs too much? Is entertainment just a pap to the masses? We certainly feel a sense of discomfort from the extreme forms presented in the ""Feelies"" but are we really that distant?Set against this are characters who rebel, who feel they are repressed, who feel the need to be alone, who want to pair with a single other person instead of being promiscuous, who feel individual ford-dammit! In the extreme this is represented by ""The Savage"" - a boy born of a mother who came from the world Huxley portrays but is accidentally left in a reservation where the backwards old-world (e.g. our world) ideas persist. The savage does not fit in in either world - rejected by the other members of the tribe for being the wrong color and for the promiscuity of his mother, found to be too weird in the conditioned ""modern"" world where his ideas are too weird.It can easily be argued that Huxley has created too extreme characters - particularly in the savage who is into self-mutilation and extreme sacrafice. However, it is by the use of these characters that some of the subtleties come out and so long as we see them as simple foils I don't think we need to get too caught up in them.It's too easy to view this book as some kind of vision of the future and laugh. In one very early episode they are showing new employees around the bottling plant (the bottling of fetuses of course!). There is all this technology to manufacturer babies according to precise specifications and then the proud guide indicates the massive *card* index needed to record it all!

In the extreme this is represented by ""The Savage"" - a boy born of a mother who came from the world Huxley portrays but is accidentally left in a reservation where the backwards old-world (e.g. our world) ideas persist. The savage does not fit in in either world - rejected by the other members of the tribe for being the wrong color and for the promiscuity of his mother, found to be too weird in the conditioned ""modern"" world where his ideas are too weird.It can easily be argued that Huxley has created too extreme characters - particularly in the savage who is into self-mutilation and extreme sacrafice. However, it is by the use of these characters that some of the subtleties come out and so long as we see them as simple foils I don't think we need to get too caught up in them.It's too easy to view this book as some kind of vision of the future and laugh. In one very early episode they are showing new employees around the bottling plant (the bottling of fetuses of course!). There is all this technology to manufacturer babies according to precise specifications and then the proud guide indicates the massive *card* index needed to record it all! However, as I started, this isn't a vision of the future, it's a fictional world which acts as a bedrock for the presentation of ideas and it's the ideas which are the beauty of the book.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

There is no class warfare because greed, the basic ingredient of capitalism, has been eliminated. Even Deltas and Epsilons are content to do their manual labor. This contentment arises both from the genetic engineering and the extensive conditioning each individual goes through in childhood.Freedom (as well as art and religion which are results of freedom) in this society has been sacrificed for what Mustapha calls happiness.

This grey happiness is the ultimate goal of the World Controllers like Mustapha.Yet Mustapha has incorrectly associated lack of pain with happiness. Only the Savage knows that true happiness comes from the knowledge that one has value.

B000BUGDZ0,Brave New World,,A34RCN1URH82H2,Jon Torodash,0/0,5.0,1080518400,This work is fiction - similarity to real life events purely coincidental.,"Many critics don't appreciate when they speak disparagingly of Huxley's predictions that he had written them in 1932. How different was the socio-cultural fabric of the ""modern"" world at that time! This rebellious icon undoubtedly overexaggerated - that was the point - but I doubt even HE suspected ""Brave New World"" would make him look this clairvoyant. None of his contemporaries would have guessed how close he came to modern genetic engineering, rampant SSRI and sedative use, sexual liberation, mass food fortification, and the direction public education is heading. Whether Huxley was a bitter intellectual who embraced counterculture only insofar as it got him attention is besides the point. Real 21st century life would be just as much ""science fiction"" to depression-era intellectuals, and he came a lot closer than Orwell or H. G. Wells.Huxley's writing is a little disconcerting at times, vacillating between different scenes of action without contextual or even speaker reference.

The novels are very different in tone though, reflecting the period in which they were written. Orwell's cold war era novel presents a world that is bleak and brutal and heavily influenced by events in Soviet Russia. Orwell wanted 1984 to be a realistic portrayal of what the world would be like under a totalitarian regime.Brave New World was written in 1931, before the world became aware of Stalin's atrocities, before the rise of Hitler, and before WW II, and as a result it is hopelessly naive compared to cold war era novels, like 1984.Some reviews would have you believe that Huxley has predicted the future with startling accuracy - but this is just ridiculous. Anyone can read any novel set in the future and find at least some part of it reminiscent of the way things are today. It's not much different than reading your horoscope and convincing yourself that it was written just for you. The world Huxley presents in Brave New World bares only a superficial resemblance to present day (or any likely future).But I don't actually think Huxley was trying to predict the future. He wanted to say something about Britain's rigid class structure, about the materialistic nature of society, and about what it means to be happy. He set his novel in the future so he could exaggerate aspects of society as a form of social commentary. Brave New World is satire. It was never meant to be realistic.Novels like Brave New World and 1984 spend a considerable amount of time explaining the way things are in the imagined future. This can be interesting, but it's no substitute for a story. Brave New World, unfortunately, lacks a strong narrative flow. Our protagonist isn't even introduced until half way through the novel.Brave New World isn't terrible but the lack of a clear voice and the absence of even one likeable character made it difficult for me to feel engaged. John, the savage rebel is so earnest and idealistic and has such a pathetically romanticized view of the world that I didn't find him particularly interesting. The ending of the novel was inevitable, given the character's obsession with the tragedies of William Shakespeare. I suppose we are meant to be moved by the events in the final few pages - but I wasn't. This is the biggest problem with the novel. Huxley may give us a vision of the future that is intriguing, but he doesn't deliver a story that engages us or give us a character we can care about.Brave New World is worth reading as a curiosity but despite its potential, Huxley's novel fails to deliver on its promise.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

As humans, we have the tendency to not think of the past and just live to satisfy the future; but with Huxley's Brave new World, we can imagine just how brilliant his fantasy world is, yet also how controlled and restricted a possible future life could be.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

Minerd ""The Coding Catholic""",0/0,4.0,1204329600,Stark Tale of Life in an Objectified World,"For very long did I desire to read Huxley's classic, Brave New World, given as I am to the dystopias which were written in the first half of the twentieth century. I can only say that I am disappointed that I waited as long as I did to take up the text.The first tier of the text which remains startling to almost all who read it is the base objectification of mankind through scientific and social ""programming"" and ""planning."" Indeed, this is usually the first thing which comes to mind when one recollects the first time that he or she read the text. In many ways, it does remain an excellent vantage point from which one can jump into the full meaning of the text, for who can but shudder at the words of Mr. Foster, ""Nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par"" and realize that there is some deeper malaise of the human soul being investigated in this text.Indeed, the powerful core of the text which truly makes it relevant regardless of whatever technical progress may occur in the world is the fact that Huxley shows the reader the end result of hyper-objectification of the self and the world. This objectification is manifested in the scientific and social structures which undergird the society in the text but also breaks forth in several other major ways. The use of soma for escape from pain and trouble is an attempt to run away from that subjectivity which raises the objective experiences of life to a more fully human level, allowing the individual to more rationally (and emotively) know where his/her place is in the whole of the world. The lack of delay in gratification once again is a destruction of the subjectivism which allows all pleasure to be such because the individual pines for the object.The mark of a great work is not necessarily that it is so unique that it is unlike anything else. Myth is all the greater, as Chesterton would say, because it is not the story of a particular man but of mankind. In many ways, Brave New World fits this mark well. Alexis de Tocqueville once said that a society would be more likely to fight to keep the comforts which it may accrue that to fight for freedom. Huxley, in his later reflections entitled ""Brave New World Revisited"" says that man may for a while be more likely to say ""Give me hamburgers and television"" over ""Give me liberty."" One can hardly forget the world of Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 where pleasure and escape are the choice of all society. However, Huxley also adds the corrective that as these objects rationed the subject will once again cry, ""Give me liberty or give me death."" Characters like Bernard Marx, Helmhold Watson, and John the Savage stand out as those who, through the pains of realizing their subjectivity, glimpse at the glories (and dangers) of humanity. This corrective remains a hope, although Huxley also reminds us, like Plato and Christ, that the truly holy and jus man will be killed, forced into exile, or left to twist in the wind.Brave New World is a timeless dystopia because it deals with these sempiternal and ubiquitous questions of humanity. It is oracular today in a world which, in its more cosmopolitan and even suburban settings, will look to the television and listen to the radio but will not be silent under the stars. We share in the malaise of the day and are not impervious to its pernicious tendencies. Therefore, we should take heed an hear the words of Mr. Aldous Huxley.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

B000BUGDZ0,Brave New World,,A228DLA3BJ3DVD,N. Andreassen,1/1,3.0,1347667200,A slightly differing opinion,"Like most other reviewers, I was required as a student to read this book (probably in high school) but could only recall one or two minor episodes and decided to give it another go as an adult. BNW is far from horrible--a few scenes are even charming--but I don't quite agree with most of the five-star reviewers here and don't think this book would endure much longer if it were dropped from public school curricula.First of all, let's admit that all the books selected for students to read in our schools are chosen mainly for brevity. Many of our ""great books"" are simply novella-length works that have no dirty words. In this case, what we're looking at is a short novel--Brave New World--in which all the characters are very shallow--each of them (okay, we can argue about the savage, but I'd suggest he's only a supporting player) does only one thing and has only one single, character-defining mood. This makes BNW more of a pantomime or fable than it is a genuine novel. Further, none of these characters undergoes any changes. Granted, the external circumstances will change for a few of them, as soon as the novel is over (in fact I'd really like to know what happens next)--but none of the characters undergoes a realization or awakening. Do they? They all just get moved from one societal pigeonhole to another. And the climax of the novel is a philosophical discussion, but that discussion might just as well have been presented in chapter one, since all that's needed to generate it is to get a certain pair of these characters together in the same room at the same time. The plot of BNW is just a conveyer belt to brings these two characters together. And again, neither one of them is changed by their confrontation (even if one leaves it better informed). Within these sorts of limitations, BNW probably is still a book ""that everyone should read."" Just don't expect any flesh-and-blood human beings in these pages or expect more than pantomime emotions. This is a parable.I also want to point out a couple of things that the other reviewers here seem to have overlooked (no, I didn't read all of these reviews, but I did read most). For one thing, the utopia or dystopia in BNW is a Communist state. (That's probably the other reason why we all read this book in school--it was supposed to bolster our fear of the Commies and what they would do to us if they ever got the chance. Anyone who doubts that this ""new world"" society is communistic should notice that the two main characters are named n honor of Marx and Lenin.) True, this new society also worships Henry Ford--but they do so because of Ford's pioneering role in mass production, not for his contributions to capitalism. Since these people also worship Freud (and even consider Freud a dimension or alter-ego of Ford), it's clear that their love of Ford stems from his efforts to make our society more like an ant farm, which of course is the very same reason they value psychology. In short then, reviewers who comment that our own society is becoming ""more and more like"" this brave new world must have overlooked a critical dimension. If we are becoming ""more and more like"" these fictional characters, it's not because of Communism or the top-down governmental coercion seen in the novel, but rather it's because we have free will and a free market system that targets the pleasure principle. In other words, the reader ought not just to consider the commonalities between ""us"" and ""them,"" but also to bear in the mind the DISTINCTIONS. We are like them--but not for the reasons that Huxley predicted. We are like them because, in effect, a consumer economy which consistently targets the lowest common denominator is, equally, a kind of psychic tyranny. Or so at least this novel might suggest.Another thing I didn't read in the reviews here is mention of the fact that NONE of the characters in BNW are truly happy--and this in a society which claims individual happiness to be the paramount good. Every single character here whom Huxley considers as a distinct individual turns out to feel unfulfilled in the new brave world and--despite all the heavy conditioning they've each endured--each one secretly feels out of place somehow. Several reviewers here have concluded that all these characters are ""exceptions"" to the rule of a generally blissful society--but a more logical conclusion would be that they each represent the societal norm and that no one in the dystopia is as comfy--even after all their extensive conditioning--as their programmers would have you believe. In other words, don't believe all that hype in chapter one. I suggest Huxley is saying that the brave new world fails everybody--not that it works for most, but a couple of unfortunate souls might get lost along the way. If a society truly works for most, then it ought to be morally acceptable, at least under the ""greatest good for the greatest number"" theory. But in this book, there's a ""new world order"" that brings authentic happiness to virtually no one. Their whole ideology is nothing but an advertising campaign, and every citizen whose private thoughts we're allowed to peep into lives that same old life of quiet desperation we all know so well.I can't decide if I'm done with this review or not.

These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

B000F6H01Q,Pride and Prejudice,,A3OH101U0CPUC7,Joseph Boone,2/2,5.0,1182470400,A True Classic,"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

Thurlow,2/2,5.0,1202774400,Pride and Prejudice: The Source....,"Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, ""Pride and Prejudice"" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife."" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']

This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these ""free"" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these.",['Jane Austen'],['Fiction']
B000F6H01Q,Pride and Prejudice,,AQCQ5F0OJXMG9,Crystal Starr Light,4/5,5.0,1292544000,The sweetest romance ever,"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's ""poor connections"".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Notice that there is a cliff-hanger at the end of each chapter and that each ensuing chapter jumps to another group of characters to create a sense of ""drama"". Try reading alternate chapters in the second book and see how interesting the plot development actually is (not). ...(Here, Tolkien is blatantly plagiarising from his amazed that Mathew, Mark Luke and Ringo have not sued!).Once the world of Middle Earth had been mapped out it could not have been too difficult to fill with an infinite succession of repetitive, different-but-the-same, baddies for our hairy heroes to face as they trudge from chapter to chapter. Why, when the programmers of shoot-em-up games like Quake do exactly the same basic thing (but make it much more fun), are they not lauded as great authors by the literary set? Surely they should be in for honorary degrees from Oxford University?Tolky squeezes this infinite potential for all that it is worth and we trudge through baddie after baddie, for thousands of pages. Bright ten year olds may be excused for mistaking a fat book for a great one - and let's face it this is an elbow-acher of a book. But only a feeble minded adolescent reader could ignore the other glaring problems of this piece. Not only of Tolk's limitations of style but also that the South African born author has laced his children's fantasy with his ugly, ugly views on race. If I were a responsible teacher, I would have this book removed from the school library and burned. If this ""epic"" isn't banned in order to save the rainforests (oh yeah, - isn't the internet supposed to reduce book production?), it certainly should be banned for Tolkien's racism.In the edition that I read (some years ago), the species that live in the middle of Middle Earth (Europe) are all elegant, cultured, decent and fair skinned (i.e. white). The ""swarthy"", (darkies to you and me), heathen hordes that live to the South and to the East are all featureless, baddies, worshipping evil and with characters never developed to any degree of interest. To deny a character human traits and complexities that we can relate to is the cheapest way of manipulating audience sympathies. There is even some suggestion that they ride strange beasts with big ears (African and Indian elephants). The surviving heroes (well, those who aren't so unfortunate as to have been born lower class), sail off across a great ocean to live in a Valhalla land in the West (America).Is this simple translation from existing facts and myths into thinly disguised fantasy the real source of Tolk's ""vast imagination""? Whatever the answer to that question, exploit the lower class"". Some lost souls rant about the great struggle between Good and Evil in this plot. ""GOOD IS WHITE AND EVIL IS BLACK"" is as sophisticated as it gets. This might have been OK for what is essentially a children's book, but to define Good and Evil by Race is not OK. Intelligent people are marked by their ability to out there, but it's wobbly"". If you have an evening, read A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin and see how much more intelligently Good and Evil can be approached in fantasy. Whilst other racist works of the era have been deleted, The Tolkiad, it seems, generates too much money to be curbed by race laws. favour, spend six months reading a book on computer programming, or investment management instead and really improve your life.

A more serious sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, while still a single coherent narrative, unlike &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and subsequent barrel-scrapings. The LOTR is not explicitly a kids' book like the Hobbit, but neither is it a fully adult piece of Modern Fantasy.If you try to read it too young, you will be scared off by the high-toned heroic writing style that develops after the first few chapters. If you leave it too late, the Gate to this Particular Otherworld will be locked for you. 'Too Late&quot; may be as young as 12 or somewhere in early adulthood. The story is a simple quest. The good guys (not many gals here!) are whiter-than-white, and the bad guys are horrid. Given the depressing result of JRRT's experiments with moral ambiguity in 'The Silmarillion', this may be as well. The major achievement of LOTR is the creation of a self-consistent world with a long and detailed history, linguistically plausible languages, and a believable mix of low-key magic with everyday physics. This was a major innovation in the first half of the 20th century when JRRT was evolving the framework for the Middle Earth books. However, it should be noted that other writers have achieved this since, with appreciably more realistic characters and storylines, and less explicit lifting from Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology. Vastly overrated, but undeniably influential, this trilogy is a flawed masterpiece. I am amazed that I have weaned off it enough to become critical.

Tolkien creates and sustains a credible alternate reality with exquisite detail - even including maps and complete languages for multiple races. Written as an exercise in creating a modern-day fairy tale, it easily transcends the genre into a truly stunning epic.LOTR and ""The Silmarillion"" comprise a unique convergence of scholarship and insight into the nature of good, evil, and heroism, all told in a totally engrossing tale. I first read it in 1968, sitting in a motel room, suffering from the flu at a job site far from home. I became so engrossed, I read all three volumes at one sitting, sending me back home in urgent need of medical care. I've since read it four more times and, having recently seen the movie, will soon read it again.When ""The Silmarillion"" was published, I also read it cover-to-cover in one sitting, but fortunately I wasn't sick then. Unfortunately, I read ""The Hobbit"" after LOTR, which was a mistake. Since ""The Hobbit"" is a children's fantasy story, it's a real letdown if you've already delved in to the rich detail of LOTR.The only caveat is that this is not an easy read. It's easy to get lost in all the detail, but the effort pays huge dividends. One of my grandduaghters read it at age 11 and shares my opinion of it (she hasn't yet made it though ""The Silmarillion"" though, which is an even harder read).

No modern literary fiction has been nearly so devotedly reread by its admirers.To foreshorten, hobbits are not just rabbits or even leprechauns: hobbits are Pycts (evidently migrant pygmies, who picked Britain out of all the world, before even the Celts came, following whom Romans, Saxons and Normans became Britons too). Tolkien's interlaced narrative is as Dickensian as it is medieval, and hobbits are Dickensian ambassadors to Valhalla.Like all of Tolkien's fictions, The Lord of the Rings is a saga: the story of a family's place in the history of the world. Frodo and Sam, master and servant, become family. With reference presumably to Malory's Arthur, Tolkien termed The Lord of the Rings a Romance. The point being that, unlike almost all other longer modern prose fictions, The Lord of the Rings is not a novel. Nor is it a fanciful gloss of medieval society, but rather of medieval literature per se.There are female characters in The Lord of the Rings, and the journeys of the Fellowship are great nature hikes. The Lord of the Rings has been translated into many languages.There are 1100+ lines of verse in the Old and Middle English alliterative meters, the long, common and half ballad measures and two neoClassical meters, the leonine hexameter and the English fourteener; plus an invented-language group in pastiches of metrical devices from various Celtic, Germanic and Latinate traditions. There is a near-hiatus of verse in volume two after its first hundred pages, and volume three's reprise of all prior metrical modalities features the Old English meter prominently. There are also Tolkien's own runes and his son's map.To the Bible belt school of Tolkien criticism I should recommend Thucydides' History of the Pelloponesian War, in which I count a few hundred parallels. The Lord of the Rings is neither childish nor humorless: it's preChristianitively stern.I look forward to a full-length animation with landscapes in the manner of Ted Nasmith and hobbits in that of Darrell Sweet, in which Sam will have a Liverpool accent.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Fantasy fiction']

It was my first fantasy series, aside from Narnia or whatever. I just liked those heroic tales about kings, princes, war, and swordfighting... I never felt comfort with other genres like science fiction, thrillers or horror.So I just stumbled on this book in the library, my first fantasy novel. You can imagine when I was sitting in my little room day and night, that cold winter 10 years ago, reading Tolkien's work. I finished the whole series in just two weeks. That day when I turned the last page of the third and last book ""The Return of the King"" I thought I wouldn't read any better series. I promised myself I would read them again another time... Easy cake right? So I thought...Years passed and I eventually became a better reader with tons of fantasy books on my backbone. Today I can tell what books is a great read and what books to stay away from. I tried to read TLOTR several times, and every time I did that I gave up in 24 hours no matter what edition I bought or how much motivated I was.Why was I giving up? Well... There aren't really much of a story in theese books, is it? I almost knew what was going to happen in every next page, except for how many leaves that tree in the next forest had of course. There isn't much happening in TLOTR and because of that I couldn't read it again a second time. Other fantasy series is very enjoyable, such as George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", and you can reread it again and again without getting bored. But to me that's impossible when it comes to TLOTR even when I really wanted to, especially before the release of the excellent movies by Peter Jackson. Some Tolkien fan might mention that I should read the Hobbit or Silmarillion because it makes it easier. That might be true, but that's not my point, I mean that the story is too slow and not engaging enough after a while.In my opinion TLOTR is great if you never have read it before, but after that I don't think most of you'll be able to read it again unless you suffer from sever Alzheimer's and have forgotten everything or are a Real fan that can speak those Elven language and dress as a Hobbit like Peter Jackson :) ( Those Tolkien fans I have met acts more like a cult, if they saw me writing this review I would be found in a dark alley motionless).I know that that many authors ""copied"" Tolkien's world. Almost 89 percent of the fantasy books begin with the journy of a boy (Frodo) who will try to save the world from evil with the guidance of a mysterious hero (Gandalf or Aragorn).

This is a masterpiece of storytelling,"I first received *The Lord of the Rings* as part of a boxed set, complete with *The Hobbit,* for Christmas in 1985. I also received a boxed set of the first four *Dune* books. I was 13 and in 8th grade.Like many 13-year olds, I loved *The Hobbit* but I thought *The Lord of the Rings* was simply awful. For one thing, the plot was not immediately obvious to me. (Keep in mind that at the time my enjoyment reading primarily comprised Doctor Who novelizations and Choose Your Own Adventure books.) Instead of the short chapters of plot and dialogue to which I was accustomed, Tolkien provided page after page of exposition, describing the local color and history with any ""action"" provided almost as an afterthought. And then there is what may have been the biggest problem of all with *The Lord of the Rings,* the scores of strangely named characters and places, some of whom are central to the story and others of whom are purely peripheral and which is which is unclear. I mean, sheesh, who names their two main villains Sauron and Saruman, names that differ by only one syllable?It should be here noted that while I loved reading at age 13, I was also not the best reader. Memories of reading what I managed to of the trilogy consist mainly of reading a single page over and over and over again just to follow the main thread of the story. Somehow I managed to finish *The Fellowship of the Ring* and made it a few dozen pages into *The Two Towers* before I threw up my hands and abandoned Tolkien to the realm of ""authors I think are overrated."" I still have a vague recollection of giving a a pretty worthless presentation on the first book in front of Mrs. Fox's English class, the same class I was in when the Challenger exploded. (I also have an even vaguer memory of reviewing some disposable piece of genre SF calledDushau (Dushau Trilogy, No 1), but that's another story.) In short, I never thought I would ever read this book again, and considered all those folks who worshiped Tolkien to be little short of fools.Fast-forward sixteen years. It's Christmas time in Champaign, and I'm attending *The Two Towers* with my coworkers, mainly because the bosses gave us cinema tickets for the holidays. As the movie begins to unfold, I remember those few dozen pages that I read at 13, and I slowly begin the journey of reappraising Tolkien. While I agree with those who urge reading the book as well as simply seeing the movie, I think that in this case I could not have done the former if I had not done the latter. Peter Jackson's trilogy allowed me to familiarize myself with the overall story arch (something that was hard for me to do from within the perspective of the novel, at least at first) and also helped me to handle the enormous cast of strangely named characters. (Finally Saruman and Sauron were decidedly distinct characters in my mind's eye, and the logic behind their naming, based as it is on Tolkien's invented languages, became more apparent.) So in fall of 2007 I finally decided to give the damned book another chance, mooched the one-volume ""trilogy"" (apparently Tolkien always considered it one big novel) through BookMooch, chose it over the New Testament for 2008's ""big book"" (sorry Mom), and devoured it in January, 2008.In short, I loved it, particularly the exposition and the bizarre names for characters and places. Strange, huh, how the passage of time will do that to one's sensibilities? The very features of the novel that I found off-putting in 1985, I found absolutely ingenious in 2008. The names and locations in *The Lord of the Rings* all figure into a much-vaster cosmology and narrative history, and this becomes more apparent when the reader peruses the voluminous appendices. All the details that seemed arbitrary and distracting from ""the action"" were in fact anything but arbitrary, deriving as they did from a comprehensive mythology (of a world that did not exist until Tolkien wrote it into existence!). Take for example the appendix on the ""translation"" of the text explaining why Tolkien chose English words like ""elf"" and ""dwarf"" and ""halfling"" to ""translate"" the ""original"" Elvish words. Apart from the implication that there is really an original manuscript written in Elvish, this appendix also implies that the ""elves"" in this story aren't really elves, the ""dwarves"" aren't really dwarves, etc., but that these are the closest analogs that the translator could find in fantastic literature.That these 1,000+ pages, with all their hyper-detailed exposition, are merely the tip of the iceberg of Tolkien's invented world, makes the novel all the more amazing. This really is a masterpiece of storytelling and myth-making. I can understand now why so many people love this book. I think I'm now one of them.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Fantasy fiction']

The blackish leather is very dull in finish and you better be sure to sterilize your hands before ever touching it. It shows the most minute amount of moisture or grease as a stain. I am afraid to touch it. The attached title and image on the box cover are very nice, as are the beatiful multi-color images and printing on the outside cover and spine of the book. They are much more accurate, though no more beatiful, than the graphics on the red book edition. And sorry, but I greatly prefer the ""faux"" leather cover. First of all, hello, it's RED (this is supposed to be the Red Book of Westmarch after all)! Also, the faux leather seems much less fragile to the touch and has a nice pebbly finish and sheen. The black leather cover is just dull. I've never seen such a drab leather finish on an expensive book.Inside the book, the guilded pages,the place ribbon, and the two multi-color fold out maps on the new edition are very nice features. That's all I have to say that is positive. My copy's pages are poorly centered on the spine (the bottom of the pages is barely inside the cover, and there was a lot of messy glue that I had to remove carefully. This quality lapse in assembly is inexcusable. Aside from a few pages, the prining is just black. I am not qualified to compare the typefaces, or printing and paper quality as these seem to be about equal. The Red Collector's Edition has two color on EVERY PAGE with red chapter names and page numbers. It looks beautiful. All in all, the printed pages of the Anniversary Edition are just dull by comparison.I guess it's just a matter of personal taste and many find the various quality touches of the Anniversay justify the price, but to me I wish I has not bought it. I would suggest that you find an actual copy in a bookstore to at least look it over before purchasing at Amazon's really quite excellent price.

The book does well to encompass the aspects of wealth and poverty and says good things abut both sections of culture and society. Tolkien was an anthropologist and her studies the cultures, and races of the world to create his own unique race that was wholly different from the established cultures on earth in order to make a point about race and culture that is also indirectly influenced by religion in the battle of good against evil.The door will be an enduring contribution to English letters because is was written by an English Oxford professor and also because of Tolkien's strong connections to the Catholic church and the Masonic organizations within the United Kingdom, which allowed the book to become prominent and proliferate the cultural diffusion of English Ango-Saxon traditions through our world culture.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Fantasy fiction']

Even some of the old Conan books were better stylistically. I for one could have done without the huge numbers of the word THE used in the every the description the (Kind of like Tom Clancy, ISN'T IT? WASN'T IT? DIDN'T IT?). There were some sentences that made no sense standing by themselves, and others that had typos! Typos?! Editors fall asleep?A story must have breath to fill itself in. This book was the pause between breaths in the WoT, and I hope Jordan keeps writing whatever he wants for as long as he wants - no matter how impatient and shortsighted his fans are. Some of the words used are clearly Japanese influenced, and the work of the WoT reminds me of Akira Kurosawa films - think fully developed.

The book does NOT consist of blank pages as you might conclude from reading other reviews. It contains some of the most interesting character and relationship development of any of the WoT books. Some nasty folk get their just deserts and others turn out to be more complicated and perhaps a touch less nasty then we formerly believed. And some of our heroes turn out to be a touch MORE nasty than we formerly believed. Characters are faced with, and make, tough choices. The ending leaves you desperate for the next chapter.

The publisher asked Jordan to extend it to 15 books so that they could get more money out of the series. The last four books of the series are the unfortunate consequence of this request. We're ten books into the series, and it's still buildup.Of these last four books, I believe this is the best written (how's that for a glowing review!) Of these four books, this one is laid out well and is very readable. For example, the various unrelated events are linked in time through the purification of Saidin. In addition, the worst and most unbelievable character of the series (Nynaeve) is ignored. Plus the relationship that is developing between Mat Cauthen and Tuon is well written and enjoyable. We finally get to like this character.The negatives of this book are numerous, and include:-- (Spoiler here) nothing happens in over 600 pages of an adventure novel!!-- Entire sections of the book drone on. For instance, Perrin spends chapter after chapter talking about rescuing the love of his life(Faile), and then (drum roll please) .... he buys some food so that he has more time to talk about it. It's a wonder that any of his troops are still following him.-- Jordan spends an enormous effort demonstrating how shrewd Egwene is at manipulating much more experienced women. (Spoiler, kind of--) Then she pulls a positively bonehead stunt at the end of the book to get into trouble. Her actions don't fit her character, at all! If Egwene were the type of character trying to prove herself to the other Aes Sedai, her carelessness would make sense -- but she has not been written with these characteristics. As a result, her actions smell of plot manipulation.-- Book 9 ended with the Dragon purifying Saidin, thus removing the taint from the male half of the source. Then why do we now read how much of a struggle for Rand to seize the source? I grew tired of reading these descriptions books ago.Ten books into the series and I'm stuck. If you haven't started -- save yourself!! At the rate he's moving it's going to be another ten years until the series is finished.

I really don't think it is much different than the book preceding or following it, the storylines progress slowly in all three. There are complex plots with the Aes Sedai especially and Jordan wasn't afraid to take the time to tell the story the way he wanted, kind of like Kevin Costner. You kind of have to give up keeping track of the different Aes Sedai and just try to keep the central thrust of the narrative in mind. I have many of the same gripes other reviewers have but for anyone paying attention there are so many rewarding little moments in these books that I can't hold Jordan's idiosyncrasies against him. He really cared and went to such lengths to give (nearly) all 3000 characters individuality to enrich his creation. I love the Tuon character and her backstory especially, she is a great foil for Mat who was probably Jordan's favorite character. I also enjoy Egwene trying to play politics with women 5x her age, it is somewhat believable that a young woman could pull off some of the things she does with a little help from her friends. The only character I really don't care for is Elayne and her quest to become queen, why oh why was that plotline allowed to develop and creep on for three books or whatever it is. Jordan was just fascinated with every facet of medieval times apparently. Anyway if you are into Jordan's world the way he wanted you to be this is a good book.

For something written as recent as 1950, I would have expected much better.First off, there is no mention of what happened to the plane. Just some boys on an island and the plane crash just seemed to be a way to get them there. There is no wreckage to deal with, no dead bodies smelling up the island. Secondly, there is no time reference at all. It seems that the kids hair just grew long, magically overnight. Without any mention to a timeframe, it appears they are on the island about a week. I'm sure it was longer, because nobody should have as little faith in humankind to think that we should devolve to savages so quickly. Maybe Golding did think it could happen that fast...

Such an introduction will often sour the reader's interest; deflate their desire to pursue a discourse with the fragile reality the author has set up.

William Golding really did do an incredible job of linking every vague detail in his book to the ideas he had about human nature, and the post world war II world in symbolistic forms (The Conch, The Glasses, The Beast). Still, finishing the book leaves one with a rather bitter taste in their mouth. I feel that the extraneous amounts of unnecessary violence Golding included, and the extreme behavior of the characters as the story progressed really kept me from appreciating the true artistic essence, and incredible emotion of this book.The story itself begins with a group of young military-school boys (who are assumed to have suffered a plane crash over the ocean water) landing on a small, uninhabited tropical island. Ralph, the main character, quickly steps up to leading the group, and gets the boys on track to getting rescued. He has them start a signal fire; make shelters, and just generally keeps them in a microcosmic society of the world they once knew.The society quickly breaks down though. Jack (a boy jealous of Ralph's leadership) is overcome by his urge to hunt wild pigs and have fun, and finally leaves the group over a conflict of interest about the signal fire. Gradually everyone who once followed Ralph leave him to join Jack's primordial savage hunting tribe, where they hunt wild pigs and savagely kill them. This in itself is graphically documented throughout the book, and the boys' morals are gradually replaced with more primitive instinct and reasoning.Before you know it, a book that started out fairly boringly is filled with rotting severed pig's heads on sticks talking to characters in the book (in their head, showing their mental stability starting to depart from them, but somewhat disturbing none the less), and Jack's tribe savagely killing some of the boys that didn't join them, for unclear reasons (being overcome by their lust for violence, rebellion from sane society, call it what you will). There is a sporadic parallel story going on, about a ""Beast,"" which is nothing more than the boys' respective manifestations of their worst fears (and perhaps the fear of the consequences of their actions catching up with them), and this fear feeds Jack's tribe's ruthlessness towards the end of the book. Quite predictably, the book ends with the boys being rescued, but not before Jack and his tribe almost murders Ralph.I really wish I could have appreciated this book more, but frankly the writer's negative view of the world (which was in turn reflected in his writing) was a little too depressing to be enjoyable. I do recommend the book as a good read at least once, and it is without a doubt a classic work of literature, but when it all comes down to it... I feel it is both a boring, and highly depressing story.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

One of the boys named Piggy, a very intelligent, but not liked boy, has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack, makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by, but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart, and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read, it had a an ending that leaves you thinking, and a story that makes you think about your own life, and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves, create rules, and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read, that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']
B000FML2C8,"Lord of the Flies, a Novel",,A2O3OYVJG2WZTS,Lindsay,3/6,2.0,1078272000,Lord of the Flies,"Lord of the Flies is a powerful story about a group of English schoolboys who have survived a plane crash and are stranded on a deserted island. In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys, Ralph, attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food, shelter, and a rescue signal fire.Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack, the novel's antagonist, who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book, I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example, Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon, who is shy and more sensitive than the others, seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy, because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing, his murder was very disturbing to me.Actually, the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this ""war"" against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got, the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story, cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent, I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

B000FML2C8,"Lord of the Flies, a Novel",,,,1/3,3.0,1161648000,Kristen's Review on Lord of the Flies,"This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called ""good"" island, into a ""bad"" island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order, shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

B000FML2C8,"Lord of the Flies, a Novel",,A21W6PCDZWG15R,J C E Hitchcock,1/1,5.0,1354233600,The Descent of Man,"I was educated at Maidstone Grammar School, the school at which William Golding taught for a brief period in the late 1930s, and although I did not arrive at the school until many years after Golding had left, school legend still had it that the main characters of ""Lord of the Flies"" were based upon boys he had taught at Maidstone. A friend of my father even claimed to have been the model for Jack Merridew. (It is, in fact, more likely that Golding was inspired by the boys of Salisbury Cathedral School where he was teaching when he wrote the novel).I won't set out the plot in any detail, as it seems to be well-known to virtually everyone, especially in Britain where it is frequently studied at school. (Oddly enough, despite the school's Golding connection, it was not on the curriculum at MGS and I did not read until my days at university). It concerns a group of British schoolboys, refugees from a war raging in Europe, who gradually revert to barbarism after being marooned on an uninhabited island. Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the ""desert island"", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth. This idea can be found in literature (""Coral Island""), the cinema (""The Blue Lagoon""), broadcasting (""Desert Island Discs"") and even in advertising campaigns; the makers of the ""Bounty"" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept. Golding's novel, with its deliberately anti-Utopian theme, can be seen as a reaction against this received idea; the names of the two main characters, Ralph and Jack, were borrowed from Ballantyne's ""Coral Island"".The book can be read on a number of levels. On one level it is a political allegory about the relationship between dictatorship and democracy. At first the boys try to organise themselves on a democratic basis, electing Ralph as their chief and setting up a system of assemblies at which they can discuss their concerns. A conch shell, used for summoning assemblies, serves as a symbol of their fragile democracy, but it does not last. Jack, Ralph's only rival in the election for chief, forms a group of his friends into a gang of hunters, with the aim of hunting the wild pigs which inhabit the island. As the novel progresses, more and more boys are won over to Jack's gang, until Jack effectively replaces Ralph as chief without ever being elected to the position, and is able to use his hunters to hunt down Ralph and his few remaining supporters.To readers in 1954, less than a decade after the end of the war, the parallels with the rise of Nazism would have been obvious. A charismatic leader, unable to gain power democratically, does so through force, backed by a private army and leading a movement based upon a ""them-and-us"" mentality. The new leader holds the loyalty of his followers by satisfying their material needs, creates a sense of group identity through ritual and violence against a common enemy and uses his power to persecute those defined as falling outside his group. Some who initially oppose him are persuaded to conform to the group identity through fear of the consequences if they refuse.The novel's religious implications are perhaps less obvious, but are none the less present. Golding was brought up in a free-thinking, non-religious family, but appears to have given up his early scientific rationalism in favour of an idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Jack and his original hunters are all choirboys from a Cathedral school like the one at which Golding taught- an obvious irony, given that choirboys are often regarded in Britain as symbols of childish innocence. The scenes in which they kill the pigs and then feast on them are reminiscent of primitive religious rituals; they even place a pig's head on a stick and treat it both as an offering to the ""Beast"" which they believe inhabits the island and as a sort of idol, the ""lord of the flies"" from which the book takes its name. (The expression is a literal translation of the name Beelzebub, and ""the Beast"" can also be a euphemism for the Devil). The boys' descent from innocence into savagery can be seen as symbolic of the Fall of Man, although other, secular interpretations are also possible. One of the boys, the gentle, mystical Simon, has been seen as a Christ-figure. .If the book is read either as a political or as a religious allegory, then it is easy to see Ralph as its hero and Jack as the villain. Read on a psychological level, however, the issue is less clear-cut. Ralph and Jack symbolise two different attitudes to life, and two different styles of leadership. Ralph and his close friend Piggy represent the rational, the harmonious, the logical and the rule-based; in short, they represent the civilisation which the boys have left behind. Jack and his gang represent the irrational, the will to power, the instinctive and the atavistic. Under normal circumstances, it is the first set of principles which would seem preferable to most people, but of course the circumstances in which the boys find themselves are far from normal.Adult civilisation has broken down even more comprehensively than does the boys' attempt to replicate it on the island- we learn that nuclear weapons have been used in the war. The boys, attempting to fell from that breakdown of are confronted not only with their own physical needs but also with all the terrors which assailed their primitive ancestors- terror of the dark, of the unknown, of hunger, of solitude, of dangerous wild beasts. In, these circumstances the irrationality advocated by Jack may answer their emotional needs more adequately than the rationality advocated by Ralph and Piggy, which is why he succeeds and they fail. Seen in this light, the boys' reversion to the more primitive instincts of human nature can be seen as a response to the collapse of civilisation rather than the cause of that collapse, a valuable survival mechanism in extremis rather than pure villainy.There is not enough space in this review to discuss all the many levels of meaning, including Golding's complex and multi-layered use of symbolism and imagery, in the novel, so I will content myself with the three aspects set out above, the political, the religious and the psychological. This is one of those books in which you can find more with each reading- in my view one of the hallmarks of a great work of literature. I was surprised to learn that ""Lord of the Flies"" was actually the author's first novel- surely one of the best first novels ever published.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']
B000FML2C8,"Lord of the Flies, a Novel",,A57J49BD8FO8Z,SilverMind,1/1,5.0,1354492800,Cautionary Tale,"Sometimes it's easy to see how a work can be timeless, particularly when it's based on the timeless adage that boys will be boys. Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys marooned by a plane crash on a small deserted island, with the nearest adult supervision lying beyond the vast ocean. The kids try to construct a functional society, while working towards the goal of getting rescued. But personal ambition gets in the way of common sense and everything crumbles. The novel does an excellent job of contrasting certain themes: civilization/savagery, maturity/childishness, collectivism/individualism, and so on. At times, this gets a little heavy, and the novel often reads like it was written to be analyzed by generations of high school students. The reader may also find that the descriptions of the landscape are weak and often repetitive. However, the novel draws out a great story. It is filled with suspense and frustration, and culminates in a heart-thumping climax. Even though the main characters are all boys, it sheds some critical light on human nature and the frequent conflict between the individual and the greater good. I would recommend picking this up at any age, as it is a very entertaining and somewhat frightening read.",['William Golding'],['Fiction']

I am one of those who despised it. There are definitely some good, maybe even great qualities of Lord of the Flies and the allegorical and symbolic meanings that are hidden throughout the book are important and a good thing to study in class yet, if I was given this and say, War and Peace, I would grab War and Peace in a second. The truth to why I dislike LotF so very much is a bit complicated. This book opens on a boy wandering around an island. You are given almost no information on where this boy(or the other boys who show up later) came from. There are little bits of information of their back story stuck in the book almost randomly. Unless you are paying a lot of attention to every word that Golding writes, it is easy to miss these precious details. That is not the only reason that this is not may favorite book in the world. I'm not sure if Golding purposely did this or if this is just the way he happened to write it, but the the majority of the characters seem to be purely evil and it is quite hard to read the book without feeling you have personal grudge against each one. I won't go into intimate details (just so you can read it yourself and understand the disgust I have with these boys) but each boy acts in a certain way that makes you wonder how evil a child can be when not under any kind of adult supervision or guidance. In conclusion, if you would like to buy this book, I warn you. You may be one of the ones who like it and shrug off the savagery of the boy or you could be one who can't even stand to finish it.

Ralph, ""the boy with fair hair"", is twelve years old and tries to keep the boys in order by making rules, ""'We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything'"", but the boys don't follow the rules. Piggy is Ralph's sidekick who helps him make the rules and think of ways to help them survive longer. Piggy is slightly chubby so the boys make fun of him for that, especially Jack. Jack is the hunter; he finds the pigs and kills them for food. He tries to be just as high up as Ralph, but not as many people like Jack as much as they like Ralph. Soon enough Ralph and Piggy realize that the pigs are not the only ones being hunted, but they are too. The theme of this book is civilization vs. savagery.

Obviously King sees this book as the classic that it is, for this book's inspiration shows in &quot;The Stand&quot; and various parts of the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series.

The most exciting part of the book is the last third in my opinion, but most of the book is fascinating. In today's age of short attention span, it's hard to feel the tension of rabbit squaring up against a rat, so things need to be put in perspective. But, the author definitely gets points for the metaphors and symbolism of the various rabbit warrens and what they mean to a human society. Also, a wonderful good vs. evil showdown in the end.As a pure story, it is very exciting and worth a read. From the point of view of a literary masterpiece, I do not think I could go that far. Other than a handful of characters (which are developed nicely), there isn't much development on the sub characters. Many of the transitions are abrupt, the dialogue is sometimes redundant, The narrators POV constantly changes from 3rd person Hazel, to Omniscient, to third person Bigwig.Adam's is a wonderful story teller.

B000GQXSQG,WATERSHIP DOWN - AVON #19810,,,,0/0,5.0,1099872000,Don't let the 'elil' stop you from reading this book!,"By Christina S. (New York)Watership Down by Richard Adams is a wonderful fiction story that I loved. It started off a bit slowly, but very soon after, it became very fast paced. I would recomend this book to animal lovers, and those who just love a good read.Watership Down is about a bunch of rabbits who leave their warren. Fiver, one of the smaller rabbits, had a vision that danger was coming. So he and his friend Hazel head off with a few others to find a new place to live. They face many dangers, but eventually find a place. Yet even then, they have hardships to face. Many times I was driven to tears.In many stories where the animals talk and are the main characters, humans don't exist. What I loved about this book is that humans do exist, and play a major role in the story. I also loved how you could easily relate to some of the characters. Myself, I'm a lot like Fiver. Fiver is very small and quiet. However, there was something that I didn't like about the book.Richard Adams sprinkles the rabbit speech, Lapine, in with what they say. Some words you can remember the meanings of, like 'elil' (enemy). But there are some words that aren't used as often, so you have to look them up in the glossary. It tends to slow down the reading a bit.All in all, I loved this book. The one or two minor flaws that it possesses can easily be overlooked.

Picking it up, I read the plot synopsis on the back cover, but couldn't at the time fathom from the description that the characters in the book were all rabbits. I didn't think much about reading it until a guy I had a crush on did a book report for it in our 8th grade English class. Upon hearing his praise and high recommendation, I bought it soon afterwards.... and was immediately entranced/blown away by a masterful, powerful tale of a band of brave rabbits who leave their endangered home in search of a new residence safe from harm and untouched by humans. I couldn't put the novel down if I'd tried!! ""Watership Down"" remains to this day one of my all time favorite books, and I would have to add that Richard Adams is one author who I have held in the highest regard for 20+ years. Few other authors have left such a huge impression upon me as he has with this amazing tale of love, hope, sheer terror, survival, loyalty, tenacity, intelligence, wit, and trust. Each character is distinct in the way they think, act, etc., that after a time, I nearly forgot that I was reading about rabbits. Adams really fleshes out their personalities brilliantly and makes you genuinely care about their struggles and triumphs. There was an animated movie that came out in the 1980's that was quite good and followed the book for the most part (the film is also accompanied by a breathtakingly beautiful soundtrack that fits the feel/themes of the story perfectly). However, I would very much recommend readling the book first as it is still superior, and also goes into quite a bit more detail regarding the rabbits' own unique language, folklore, and religion (of sorts). The book (and movie) both moved me to tears when I reached the ending, but I was left with a great feeling afterwards nonetheless. ""Watership Down"" is a fantastic portrayal of spirit, determination in the wake of adversity/destruction/death. I love this book immensely and it effected me in ways that few reads rarely have. It will always have a special place in my book collection, and most importantly, my heart.",['Richard Adams'],['Fiction']

B000GQXSQG,WATERSHIP DOWN - AVON #19810,,A2JV4ZX9L83IQT,Loren Eaton,0/0,5.0,1208736000,An epic cast in English hedgerows,"Adapted from ISawLightningFall.blogspot.comWatership Down has a lot in common with the ancient epics. In it, a lone warrior leads a band of harried outcasts into the wilderness in search of a home. They're aided by a seer who can touch the future with his dreams. They face perilous quests and hair-breadth escapes, ferocious foes and desperate siege assaults. But unlike the works of Homer and Virgil, Watership Down is also about rabbits. Which is appropriate, as almost all of its characters are rabbits.Most four-footed protagonists in literature have been little more than humans with fur. (Think Stuart Little or Redwall.) But Adams takes a very different tack, which is evident from the get-go. The tale begins with two young rabbits named Hazel and Fiver living in a peaceful warren ruled by an old veteran named the Threarah. Scrawny, meditative Fiver has premonitions of doom falling on them all, a doom that will stain the fields with rabbit blood. But when the Threarah ignores Fiver's counsel, Hazel decides to rouse anyone he can and flee. The two are joined by Bigwig (a massive bruiser once part of the Threarah's personal guard), Dandelion (a storyteller par excellence), Blackberry (the smart-as-a-whip innovator) and Pipkin (a loyal but timid runt). When the Threarah's minions discover their plans, the motley crew must plunge into the wilds under threat of death.Adams' break with Disney-esque anthropomorphizing becomes even more apparent in the culture he created for his rabbits. Much like Tolkien did in The Lord of the Rings, Adams created a language with its own detailed grammar and vocabulary. An example: Fiver's true name, Hrairoo, comes from hrair, the term for any number over four, which is how high rabbits can count. They call these greater sums ""thousand,"" and Fiver's name literally means ""little thousand."" He was so christened because he was small and one of the last born in his litter. Other words that crop up -- including elil (""predators""), silflay (""to graze"") and narn (""something good to eat"") -- possess equally detailed explanations. Frith, the word for the sun, is particularly interesting since it contains religious connotations. The rabbits, you see, are sun worshippers. They adore Lord Frith and the first rabbit he created, El-ahrairah, whose mischievous exploits get recounted several times in detail and who would put Odysseus to shame with his inventiveness.Part of the joy of reading Watership Down lies in not only in its mythological color, but in letting yourself be carried along by every twist and turn of the plot, which is half adventure and half thriller (with a smattering of British botany, warren geography and seagull dialect thrown in to keep things interesting). If you find it hard to believe that it could be a coherent read with so many disparate elements (much less an entertaining one), join the crowd. It took months of nagging from a friend to get me to crack its cover. But it most certainly works, which is a testimony to Adams' skill, as is the fact that when you reach the final page, you've begun to feel that Hazel and his friends are every bit as courageous as Achilles or Aeneas -- no matter the length of their ears.",['Richard Adams'],['Fiction']

Having never heard of it before, I was a little skeptical when I found out that the characters were rabbits. However, the professor promised us that we would enjoy the book once it got going. It was one of his personal favorites.Once I got through the first 50 pages or so, I couldn't put it down. I was reading any chance I had to see where the adventure was going next.

While this objective may seem simple to accomplish, the rabbits run into many obstacles along the way and such a goal becomes distant but not impossible to these fervent animals. Of course, the rabbits portray human qualities such as emotion, language, and complex cognitive thought. Needless to say then, it is obvious that each rabbit on this journey is an individual who carries their own personality. So while the novel concentrates on the journey of the rabbits itself, it effectively incorporates each of the rabbits journey also. Such a novel about brave rabbits in search for a new home, surpassing barriers, and finally reaching a content end seems to be a typical ""hero's journey."" Indeed, this plot resembles the stereotypical journey, but the author does so in such a creative and interesting way. I found that reading from an animals point of view is rather interesting, even though the complexities of their thoughts are probably unlike our own. Normally, heroes are associated with people. This novel, however, defeats that archetype extending it to our fellow creatures. Next, their journey was quite suspenseful. At first, reading about rabbits finding a new home may seem anything but engrossing. Yet here again, the author tactfully renders the journey as interesting as our own would be. Reading more into the novel, the characters grow on you and the danger they face becomes important to the reader. True, nature can be so fascinating. The book itself was rather ideal in that I began to think I was reading a child's book. Not in a derogatory sense at all. It was an easy read that was enjoyable to the point where it was as if I was a kid again enjoying a heroic story. It was not as if I as a busy college student reading the book without interest just to quickly memorize the comprehension for an upcoming test. In my opinion therefore, the author creatively takes a classic tale and generates it into an unorthodox novel.",['Richard Adams'],['Fiction']

All of it is written in his typical even-handed, charming, down-to-earth fashion. This would be my top recommendation for an enjoyable summary of Christian doctrine and practice.",['C. S.

I have read good Christian apologetic books (The Case for Christ, for example) and in comparison this book fails miserably. Lewis uses silly arguments (Moral Law?

If you do not wish to have those points revealed, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (THGttG) begins innocently enough with the pending destruction of Arthur Dent's home outside of London, England. The only thing keeping the wrecking crew from demolishing the house is his lying in front of their heavy equipment. It seems that the &quot;powers that be&quot; wish to knock down his house to make way for a much needed highway bypass. Arthur's one-man lie-in is interrupted by a visit from his friend Ford Prefect, an out of work actor. Unknown to Arthur, Ford Prefect is actually an alien field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Ford has been accidentally exiled on Earth for the past 15 years.Arthur, with the aid of Ford Prefect, stows away on board the starship sent to destroy the Earth. It seems that our planet is in the right-of-way for the new hyper-spatial bypass. After stowing away, the following bizarre events happen in rapid succession: Ford and Arthur are tortured by bad poetry, they are hurled into the vacuum of space, they are rescued from said vacuum by Zaphod Beeblebrox (the renegade Galactic President) and his sidekick Trillian (the only other surviving Earth human). Needless to say these turn of events lead to some very interesting and very funny reading.I liked THGttG. I didn't love it but I did like it. This is my second reading of the novel in 10 years. THGttG was an enjoyable if not a light almost fluffy read. Adams' light and bouncy writing style made it easy to breeze through the text. I finished the book over a 2-day period. Adams' dialogue and scene descriptions were punchy and witty, much like radio dialogue from which it was taken. The book's humor is definitely British (funny bordering on the absurd). Watchers of British comedies will know what I mean by this assertion. If fact, as I read I would hear John Cleese's (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers) voice in my head doing the narration.Although I enjoyed the book's style and tone, its story was not as enjoyable or at least not as satisfying as it should have been. At a novel's conclusion I expect most if not all questions raised during the narrative to be answered. This didn't happen with THGttG. The book left many important questions unanswered: What happens to Slartibartfast, the caretaker of Magrathea? Do the Authorities ever catch Zaphod and punish him for stealing the Heart of Gold? Why were his brains surgically altered anyway? What is the question for which &quot;42&quot; is the answer? What will the mice do now? I saw the Public Television mini-series (a combination of THGttG and it's sequel The Restaurant at the End of Time) when it came out in the Eighties, so I know the answers to my own questions. But for the readers who have not seen the series not answering these questions is too great a flaw to overlook.All in all, THGttG is an enjoyable book because of its wit and humor but it leaves too much to be desired when it comes to tying up loose ends. If you wish to enjoy the book and understand what everything in it means, read THGttG and The Restaurant at the End of Time in immediate succession.

He accomplished that much in a startlingly effective way. But what has he really told us? What actually made Stalinist Russia turn out the way it did? Was the evil in the &quot;animals&quot; that meted out their torture to the rank-and-file, or was it in the IDEAS that spawned these animals? Orwell does not explore these ideas at all, so he never gets to the root of what happened on the farm, or in Soviet Russia, for that matter. He compellingly shows us that tyranny and murder are horrible, but we KNOW that already. He never comes close to the real issue here: what ALLOWED these horrible things to take place, and how do we prevent it from taking place on other &quot;farms&quot;? Orwell, unfortunately, offers his readers no insight there.Orwell even seems to imply that, had Snowball (or Trotsky) been able to wrest power away from Napoleon (or Stalin), that everything would have been better. He fails to recognize that giving ANYONE that kind of power over individuals necessarily ends in disaster. Any ideology that demands the self immolation of the individual for the &quot;good&quot; of the collective leads to the destruction of the individual, and, eventually even to the destruction of the collective (i.e., all individuals). Unfortunately, with Orwell's book as our only guidance, we are left scratching our heads when looking for the answer to &quot;why&quot;, and left helpless against any POTENTIAL dictator who tells us he has the REAL answers.Read this book for its sensory value, then pick up THE OMINOUS PARALLELS by Leonard Peikoff (non-fiction) for a credible response to the questions Orwell leaves, not only unanswered, but unasked.",,

The book was motivated by the author's disillusionment with communism in the Soviet Union. I first read the book in my secondary school days over thirty years ago. I have re-read it several times at various intervals since then and I enjoy reading it all the time. In fact, as I grew older and wiser, my understanding and appreciation of the seriousness of the message behind the story became deeper.The book is a fable about how animals successfully rebelled against human oppression. The animals of Manor farm overthrew the often drunken farmer and established self-determination. All the newly liberated animals were filled with joy and jubilation as well as optimism and they managed to organize themselves very effectively and worked very hard to produce a bumper harvest in their first year of self-rule.The animals came up with seven commandments to ensure that all animals adhere to a high moral and ethical standard in conformity with the egalitarian principles of fraternity, equality and justice for all. These seven commandments were: any creature that walks on two legs is an enemy; whatever moves on four legs or has wings is a friend; animals are forbidden to wear clothes, sleep in a bed, drink alcohol or kill other animals. All animals are equal.Soon afterwards, things started going seriously wrong. Social classes started to emerge with pigs at the top of the social ladder. Then conditions at the farm started to deteriorate until they grew worse off than before the revolution.This is a very entertaining book with a very serious message. The book shows the terrible life under communism that people in the Soviet Union had to endure, with terrible abuses, corrupt ruling elite which did not account to anyone but itself, and that such a set up ultimately ends in failure when people say enough is enough.This book is written in simple English making it easy to read and understand for all readers ranging from school children to adults.",,

Now I will tell you about the spectacular book. The story opens up with the owner of Manor Farm locking up the gates for the night but he was too drunk to lock them properly. Meanwhile the animals were getting prepared for a meeting with the Old Major the most highly respected animal on the farm. He opened the meeting by announcing that he did not have much longer to live and that he wanted to share his dream with them before he was gone. His dream was about all animals living free lives and not be a slave to the man, he says that man is the only creature that consumes without producing, and that its time to join together and take over. He said that he can see England with only animals roaming and human free graceful land all to themselves. He ends his speech by singing Beasts Of England. A couple days later Old Major died, and the farm animals decided to put the plan in action. So now the animals decided to hold meetings almost every night and the plan happened when they did'nt even plan it. It happened when Mr. Jones was so drunk that he didnt feed the animals for two days so Boxer and Clover sneak in the food shed, but they cause too much noise and Mr. jones and his men ran out with whips. Then Boxer and Clover freaked and attacked them and scared them out of the farm. After this they start making the land theirs. They change the name of the farm (Manor Farm) to Animal Farm. Then they listed seven rules on the farm house. They were Whatever goes upon two feet is an enemy, Whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a freind, no animal shall wear clothing, no animal shall drink alcohol, no animal shall sleep in a bed, no animal shall kill another animal, all animals are created equal. Then the animals learn to farm without man and have the most sucsesful harvest ever while enjoying themselves completely. Soon the news of the rebellian is spread across half the county and now half of the county knows about Animal Farm. This inspires the other farms and they start acting up by throughing their riders off of them and not listening. Now the threat of other animals taking over is big and local farmers and townsmen decide to try an regain control of Mr. Jones's farm, but the animals sucsesfully defend their farm. When winter starts coming around, Snowball has an idea to build a windmill for electricity so the work on the farm will be less strenuous and that they could live more comfortable lives. Napolean disagrees and soon the animals go to two halfs one for Snowball and one for Napolean. They decide to have a debate and after snowball finished Napolean sent the dogs he had been training after Snowball and chased Snowball off the farm. Now Napolean was the farm leader and decided to go through with the windmill plan after all. Through the winter the animals were working like slaves to finish the windmill and still have a good harvest. Then Napolean suggests voluntary work on sundays but even though it was voluntary you would lose half of your food if you didnt work. Then Napolean says that they will begin trading with other farms for supplies. The animals dont want to because in Old Majors speach he says there should be no trade but squeler convinces them that there imagining it. Then the pigs move into the farm house and are sleeping in beds but Squeler convinces them that they are imagining it. Some go and check the rules, but they had been altered and the animals didnt know. Then a disastrous winter comes were they come to near starvation and have to fake that they had food to the neiboring farms to make themselves look better. After animals are executed they go look at the rules and again they are different they say no animal shall kill another animal without cause. Now Napolean is taking even more leadership and is making more rules for them to follow. Now Federek the local farmer decides to attack Animal Farm. The animals win just barely. After they win Napolean drinks alot and changes the rule to no animal shall drink exsessively. Now there food rations are dropping and dropping except for the pigs who are allowed to drink daily wear ribbons on sundays and they are actually gaining wait. Also Boxer is ill and Napolean promises to send him to a hospitol but the truck that takes him is actualy a butchers shop and they never see him again. Now the older animals die off and Squeler assumes leadership. The farm name is changed back to Manor Farm and the animals still work harder than any other farm and get less food than any other farm.That was the summary of the book, but the book wasnt just made up it was actually a metaphor of the Russian Revalution. I thought this was an awesome book though sad at the same time. I think it was a great idea by George Orwell to make the book a metaphor, and still have it be a great story. I would recomend this book to both genders 10-15 years old. Animal Farm ROCKS!",,

NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. Orwell, one of the most perceptive observers of human society who ever lived, was describing political life as it is lived in ALL political systems. It is true that democracies generally do not use force to impose their will on their populations the way dictatorships do, but their manipulation of public opinion, propaganda and ""well-meaning"" social engineering are all reflected in Orwell's ""fairy story"". For example...""Surely you don't want Jones back!"". Many politicians use this to justify breaking their promises by claiming that ""true, I did the opposite of what I promised, but you don't want the OTHER guys back in, so you still have to support me!""Or, how about ""Snowball is responsible!""? This is a case of a political leader demonizing some ""enemy of the people"" and blaming all their problems on this person (or religion, or class, or ideology, etc) and using this to mobilize public opinion to support the leader's policies, even if the people really don't want it, fearing that things would be worse if Snowball is allowed to act freely.This book is a warning of how unscrupulous leaders (or even basically well-meaning ones who can succumb to the temptations of power) can hijack the most idealistic movements and twist them around to benefit themselves alone. All concerned citizens who care about freedom should read this book and learn how to identify the threats to their society.",,

The pigs take advantage of their power, and they also betray their own rules.This book could say that one has to be a true saint for communism to work effectively, but in my opinion it states that if you give anyone power over another group of people, you will discover that we do not differ from the pigs in this novel.This is a true classic that everyone should read and feel inspired by.

As an allegory of the violent Russian Revolution, George Orwell's Animal Farm is a call back to the fairy tales of times past. Animals that possess the ability to think and act in a humanlike manner are the main characters, and their personalities and the events of the story directly parallel the events of the Bolshevik take over--and that is all. By sticking so closely to the original proceedings, Orwell has failed to create a story with any sense of originality.In Animal Farm, the animals of a man named Mr. Jones have grown tired of the cruel way he treats them and decide to revolt. Gaining their ideas from the teachings of a pig named Old Major and their leadership from two pigs named Napoleon and Snowball, the animals successfully take over the farm. Over the course of the book, the animals fight amongst themselves and against the humans, work to achieve prosperity, and eventually end up in a situation very similar to where they started.The animals of Animal Farm are so similar to famous figures in the Russian Revolution that it becomes possible to predict what they are likely to do next. It is easy to get caught up in looking for parallels between the animals and the Bolsheviks, rather than read the story for its own sake. To look at only the pigs, Old Major, with his talk of ""Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done,"" and point of addressing the other animals as `comrade', is a clear parallel of Karl Marx, from whom the Bolsheviks gained their ideas of socialism. Snowball and Napoleon, also, with their arguing and the eventual forced exile of Snowball, strongly resemble Trotsky and Lenin.For a reader looking to read about the Russian Revolution in a format more interesting than typical nonfiction historical accounts, Animal Farm is a good start. It is also good for a quick read, particularly if one wishes to learn a bit more about Orwell's writing style and perspective on socialism. It is not, however, a book that will appeal to a reader wanting to read an entirely unique and creative story.",,

In the last days of World War II, Billy is left with his questions of life, death, and whether or not people have free will. But Billy is unable to find any answers. Billy tries to deal with his trauma by creating alien figures called Tralfamadorians and adopt their values of life and ability to travel in and out of time. As one Tralfamadorian states to Billy, &quot;I am Tralfamadorian, seeing all times as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. It simply is . Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all as I said before, bugs in amber.&quot; Vonngut incorporates the theme of predestination into Billy life to allow him to deal with the many traumatic situations in his life. Billy's abduction by the Tralfamadorians takes him away to a foreign planet or a pleasant place in his life when he is confused or distressed. In Slaughterhouse Five, Billy takes the reader to many different moments in his life to give the reader a true understanding of what he has experienced. Through Billy's story, Vonnegut is able to ask the question of whether life is set in stone or whether the human perception of freedom to make choices is just another foolish notion that people create in order to have some control over their lives. And it is a question that Vonnegut leaves to the reader to decide.

Did it go pretty smoothly for you? M: Yes, I actually finished it pretty quickly. L: I was able to read through it fast at first, but there were so many random parts that a lot of times I had to read sections twice before I understood everything. M: I thought it was kind of choppy, and a lot of the time when I finished reading a chapter, I was confused. I think one of the best words to describe the book is &quot;random.&quot; L: Sometimes I wondered if maybe Vonnegut was trying to be random on purpose, because war can be really confusing and complicated like that. Like when someone is a soldier and they are not really sure where they are and they get disoriented and they don't know why they keep fighting because they don't understand everything about why the war is going on, just like when we were reading and we didn't understand all the parts of the book and how they connected and why we continued reading. M: I never thought of it that way, Laura! Interesting analogy. An example of the randomosity from chapter six: &quot;And Billy worked his hands in his muff as he marched. His fingertips, working there in the hot darkness of the muff, wanted to know what the two lumps in the lining of the little impresario's were. The fingertips got inside the lining. They palpated the lumps, the pea-shaped thing and the horseshoe-shaped thing. The parade had to halt by a busy corner. The traffic light was red. M: I totally remember that quote from the book because I kept laughing at the work &quot;muff.&quot; And I kept thinking to myself, &quot;What does this have to do with the story?&quot; What do you think about the quote, Laura? L: There were definetely many instances when paragraphs seemed to just come out of the blue. Sometimes there were important issues that I thought about because of different things that happened in the book, but a lot of the time I was just bewildered. M: I thought the book had some interesting ideas about war, since it is an anti-war book. Like, war is unstoppable. I liked how Vonnegut compared it to a glacier-there's no use trying to get rid of it, because it will always be there, no matter what. L: So it goes M: Ha ha, that's a good one. L: Vonnegut writes &quot;So it goes&quot; whenever death is mentioned in the book, which is very often. Usually it comes up after a human dies, but a few times it came up about other things, like plants, or book reviews. Do you think everything in the world is sort of alive? M: Sure, I think things are alive, but I'm not sure if they have feelings like humans do. They might to a certain extent, but I don't think a plant feels the same way I do! L: Let's start talking about the aliens M: This is a topic I really like. Those little green creatures crack me up. L: They sure did do a lot of crazy stuff! One of my favorites parts is when the Tralfamadorians explain how it takes something like 7 genders to make a baby. M: Or what about the part when Billy and Montana were getting it on, and the aliens watched like it was some kind of entertainment, and they (the aliens) treated them (billy and Montana) like they were some kind of animals being observed in a zoo, and it's weird to think how we watch animals in a zoo, and the aliens watched humans in their own &quot;zoo-like&quot; environment. It brought to mind a line from a popular song-You and me baby ain't nothing but mammals so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel L: Yeah! I bet if we watched ourselves (humans) from a distance, we would see a lot of pretty weird stuff occurrring. Sometimes we act strange, and do things that don't really make sense...just like Vonnegut doesn't always seem to make sense! M: Would you recommend this book to a friend, Laura?

This represents a good descrpition of this book's ideals. When the main character, Blly Pilgrim, lives different parts of his life throughout the book, is where the novel takes a rather unappealing turn.

Blending science fiction with his memoirs Vonnegut has created a meta-fictional novel where time travel is a primary plot device; one that allows him the freedom to dismiss chronology in the telling of his tale.Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran, having been a prisoner of war in a converted abattoir in Dresden. Years after the war he is involved in a plane crash which causes him to become ""unstuck in time""; a strange condition that allows him to travel to any point in his life, or even to the planet Tralfamadore where the aliens that live there view life as a single representation of every moment. Through his frequent travels in time, Billy Pilgrim gets to relive many points of his life such as Dresden, his marriage, and even his death; all of these combine to show Billy's attempt at making sense of the world, his fatalist conclusions permeating the novel.The story of Billy Pilgrim doesn't start until the second chapter, the first, instead, being the author's apology for the novel's mess (although he states you can't make sense of a massacre) and how, in his mind, the book came to be. The prose is minimalist and repetitive. Phrases appear regularly or statements reappear reworded. The use of ""so it goes"" whenever something dies, be it a person or bubbles in champagne, is understandable, however, in its need to demonstrate death as something routine and cheap, it does become grating.There are many characters in Slaughterhouse 5 although I don't feel that any of them were given much depth. People appear for a paragraph and then Billy Pilgrim is off on his travels before you have a chance to get to know them. Even Billy failed to hold my attention, possibly because we fail to really get to know him. The author spends time telling us about him rather than showing him doing anything which, I feel, cheapens the experience. His condition, that of being ""unstuck in time"", leaves a nice ambiguity about the novel although it's highly probable that his travelling is a delusional passage between memories brought on by the trauma of witnessing the bombing of Dresden.Maybe the book is a product of its time or maybe there's something I'm missing but Slaughterhouse 5 is not a novel I'd recommend. Having no experience of Vonnegut's other work I can't say whether this book, being part memoir, is a typical example of his canon. While the novel is understandably a mess, I can't help but feel that the prose and characterisation are lacking and what, on paper, sounds like a great idea has been put through a literary slaughterhouse.

At least I think I have an idea what was happening in this story, which was far from the experience I had with Faulkners ""The Sound and the Fury"" (which I gave up on).",['Kurt Vonnegut'],['Fiction']

I was glad to find out it was about the history that I was familiar with due to my interest in the American Civil War. Cold Mountain focuses on a different side of the war than I am used to reading about; it is focused on the internal life in a soldiers instead of his life on the battlefield.Inman's only desire while on his struggle through the mountains was to maked it back to his beloved Cold Mountain and Ada. At the same time Ada was on her farm in the mountains of North Carolina trying to grow her daily bread from a farm that she didn't have the skills to run. Both stories are extremely heartbreaking.I really loved this book, and I feel that it is worth reading again.There are many stories within the story that kept me glued to the book. I really felt that Inman would give up his journey and live with some of the people who he encountered on his trip home. This book will make you look at the life of a soldier in a different way. Too many books glorify war and show the manly side of fighting; this is not one of them. Inman fights and kills for his own survival, and in these fights YOU will want his enemies to die almost as much as Inman does.Finding out that this book was based on a true story only added to the excitement of the book.

It's a matter of real survival but the learning process Ruby submits Ada to is made a real thing of beauty by the author - as if Ada is awakening to the meaning of life and its meaning is found in the inherent detail of doing the daily things of farm work that are a drudge but are given a purpose and meaning. What seems a daunting even impossible task - running a farm in the wilds of of the mountains - comes a lesson on life. Ruby's secret is "" not to get ahead of yourself. Go at a rhythm that could be sustained on and on. Do just as much as you could do and still be able to get up and do again tomorrow. No more, no less."" Samuel Beckett would agree with this. Moving constantly between Inman's returning odyssey and Ada's waiting and life establishing work, the novel never flags in interest. Whether an aside concerns apple picking, or fiddle playing, or drawing a hog, or star gazing, Frazier makes it a thing of beauty and wonder - no mean achievement. A substantial part of his achievement is the language which is perfectly suited to the time and place and seems to catch the truth of the characters so effectively. One further example: Stobrod, Ruby's Daddy, is not an especially likeable character, a lazy irresponsible scallywag actually, but following the evolution of Stobrod's music, how he constructs his fiddle, learns to play, improvises melodies, and composes, is in itself a study in musical appreciation of the most sympathetic kind. The music created is not external to the maker but a natural and inevitable expression of his soul. "" As the tune drew toward a close, Stobrod jacked back his head so that he seemed to be reviewing the stars, but his eyes were shut. The butt of the fiddle pressed against his heart and the bow worked in jerky, stuttering little strokes. His mouth flew open at the ultimate moment, but he did not hoot or squeal as Ada expected. Instead, he smiled a deep long smile of silent delight."" This is revelatory writing. There are many such moments in this novel. Incidentally, this novel is far far superior to the rather flat film of the same name starring Nicole Kidman et al",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A1NHHWGXHBF7LV,"""really-siobhan""",2/2,5.0,963964800,TWO PEOPLE _DREAMING TOGETHER,"Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain is an amazing first novel. His characters are rich and real. An updated telling of Homer's Odyssey, Frazier, like his Greek forefather, reaches into mythology to show how the characters are more than their physical selves: they are points in history, the fulfillment of centuries of social and political events, religious beliefs and personal destinies and dreams. Inman, the hero, is more than a reluctant soldier and more than an avatar of Odysseus. Walking home after recovering from his war wounds instead of returning to battle, he marks the beginning of the counter-mythology of war: the soldier who is disallusioned with the cause for whom there is only guts and no glory. Interestingly, the woman he longs for, Ada, is also something new. She foreshadows the liberated women of the 20th century. By allowing herself -- the daughter of an aristocrat fallen on hard times -- to be taught by lower class Ruby, she learns the value of work and stewardship of the land. Cultured and well-educated, she allows her sensuality to come to the fore, making her truly worthy of Inman's trek home to her. Some readers have been disturbed by the use of mythology and folk music, but once they learn that old traditional songs, like &quot;Three Ravens&quot; in which a pregnant woman in the guise of a doe comes upon her fallen husband, are woven through the book and serve to foreshadow events within it, they become more accepting of the improbable elements. During the first broadcast of Ken Burns' &quot;The Civil War,&quot; the point was made that if anything would have created an American epic, it would have been that conflict. At the time, I said that we are not a people who rely on epic poetry and ours is no longer an oral culture; therefore, it is not surprising that there has been no American epic. In the 20th century, we use the cinema to spread our mores and ideas and tell our stories, so that, for good or bad, the epic of the Civil War was Margaret Mitchell's &quot;Gone with the Wind,&quot; and its cinematic adaptation. However, what Frazier has done is simultaneously look backwards -- to Homer and the beginnings of Western civilization -- and stand in the present -- by borrowing the technique of magical realism and apply this to the American Civil War. He retells an event in American history and honors 19th century American culture through the inclusion of ballads and folktales. Mitchell wrote a &quot;rippin' good yarn,&quot; but Frazier showed how the Civil War changed America and defined this country for the 20th century and he did it by being respectful of our greater cultural heritage. He also created a wonderful love story, of two people, separated by circumstances that ultimately were not beyond their control who were able to fulfill their dreams of each other. Frazier may have redefined what an epic is and he produced a love story that is stronger and more romantic than the tale of Scarlet and Rhett. By the way, if anyone is interested in the sort of music Charles Frazier carried in his head while writing Cold Mountain, American musician extraordinaire Tim O'Brien recorded the songs of Cold Mountain.",,

It describes communities where strong women (Ruby) step into the breach to provide for their families and communities. It exposes the horrors of slavery.

Why? The writing, plain and simple. It is BEAUTIFULLY written. You get the feeling that each and every word was painstackingly thought out and purposely placed. A very, VERY good read!The story centers around Inman as he works his way back home after deserting the Confederate army, all the while thinking of Ada, the woman he thinks he was meant for. And about 1/3 of the book is from Ada's perspective, as she contemplates life and Inman, the man she almost wonders if she wasn't destined for. What's most fascinating to me, is that Inman and Ada are actually the author's great-great-grandparents, and so the author's heart is VERY much into the story and makes it as good as it is.A minor con that some readers may find, was some of the words you just don't know! I found myself looking up many words to fully understand what was being said. For instance, I remember looking up one word (can't remember it) which meant &quot;a wicker basket made of [some certain plant/and or material].&quot; Am I complaining? NO! I really appreciate that kind of detail and it made me want to know my English better! And I certainly didn't need to have a dictionary handy to enjoy it, and neither will you. If you REALLY know your vocabulary, you'll enjoy the book even more than I did.One very minor complaint I have to mention is that there wasn't much of a feeling of suspense. But it's very forgivable as the words just roll around in your brain, and if you're one of those people who mark beautiful passages and/or quotes in books, you may find yourself needing a second highlighter! A highly recommended read, and I would actually give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the lack of suspense, but you won't read it for suspense so much as you will to appreciate the language.

However, the poetic language serves only to make his novel all the more jarring. The content is grotesque, bloody, disturbing, morbid, and simply depressing, and left me exhausted and unhappy when I finished it. I felt literally sick. One might say, then, that Frazier is a very effective writer, since his words engendered such an effect in me, but I felt no pathos for the characters, and so the novel failed in that respect. Inman would have been more aptly named Inhuman, and Ada was snobby and selfish. Both main characters lacked all worth and merit, other than the fact that their bodies were able to withstand hard work and physical punishment. The final blow didn't bother me in the least, because I never cared for the miserable characters to begin with. I only felt numb. Other parts of the story offended me outright; they seemed ludicrous. Ruby was the one character I liked, simply because she was stubborn and knew her way around. But then Frazier causes her to commit an act in the epilogue that is simply unforgivable. In addition, the ending was easily predicted: what could be more natural in Frazier's world of despair than for the strivings of these characters, and all Frazier's poetic words, to come to naught?

The way the two protagonists (Ada &amp; Inman) each have thier own perspectives and think about one another throughout the book (even though they hadn't promised even to see each other after the war) was compelling.

Popular images of the antebellum South depict white mansions with wide, well tended lawns and gentlemen sipping Mint Juleps, where life was rich and easy. From the first page, this book discredits that idea, and, in it's place, gives the reader a glimpse of what was surely the more realistic life of an ordinary Southerner. Written in a generally dark tone which suits the subject matter, the book is so detailed that I found myself smelling the hay, rain, and mud where Inman slept in hayricks, hearing the emptiness of the house while Ada struggled to deal with her emotions and situations after her father's death. The book left me wondering how and why so many men were convinced to march to war and away from their peaceful and ordinary lives to fight a war that was in no way theirs.

B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A3C2WKP1LZKMU,"Tammy L. Schilling ""tammyl84""",7/15,3.0,1068681600,Not worth the time,"There is much that one could say about Cold Mountain. As a winner of the National Book Award, it certainly has something praiseworthy in it's prose. Individually, the chapters are written in a lyrical way, with stunning detail that evokes the intentionally grim mood of the book.Of the plot, there is precious little to say, for there is precious little plot at all. Inman is on a journey home, on foot, after desserting the army during the Civil War. On the way, he encounters endless trials to the point of ridiculousness. While this is clearly an attempted to homage to The Odyssey, it doesn't come off well in this book, and simply makes Cold Mountain look worse for the comparison. Ada, Inman's sweetheart prior to the war and ultimate goal of his journey, has inherited a non-working farm from her recently deceased father. Now she struggles, ala Sally Field in Places in the Heart. Ada's story is considerably more interesting than Inman's and provides the only attempt at plot that will draw the reader in at all.The form and pacing of Cold Mountain may be of interest to some readers. The book starts off painfully slow, actually picks up speed in the middle, and then comes to an abrupt end. While I don't typically like to give readers the ending, I will here (for those who care to read it). Near the end, Inman suddenly is home and finds Ada. They spend one passionate, snowed-in night together, and then Inman gets himself killed by soldiers looking for desserters. This ending is typical of so many modern authors who use literary devices not to effect, but because they can. In this story, it serves no purpose but to make the reader feels as if the author is saying to them &quot;so there, hah!&quot;, like a small child.While Cold Mountain certainly has some well written and lovely prose, it is overall not worth the time. If a reader is interested in a journey, then get the real Odyessy, and skip this sad imitation. If you do decide to give Cold Mountain a shot, be forewarned that you will have to give it at least 100 pages before you can begin to feel invested in this book (and one really isn't sure if you are invested in the story, or the 100 pages that you have already read) and it will not end happily.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A2B1GZIRD6W646,David W. Nicholas,17/32,2.0,1068854400,"Overwritten, pretentious, ponderous","This much-acclaimed first novel but Charles Frazier follows two plot threads. In the one, Civil War Confederate soldier Inman (we never learn his first name) deserts his hospital bed while recovering from yet another wound, and begins the long trek back to Cold Mountain, where his lady love awaits him. The other thread involves the aforementioned lady love, Ada, who has a farm she doesn't know how to care for. She acquires an assistant, a young homeless woman named Ruby who's been wandering the hills, but knows more about farming. Together they work the farm, waiting for Inman.Sounds like a promising premise for a novel, doesn't it? I'm a Civil War buff who enjoys historical novels, and serious fiction (though not much of the modern stuff, to be honest) and so I thought that it would be a perfect fit for me. I have even been told how good it was by people I've met at parties and so forth. So I had to read it. And boy was I disappointed.For one thing, Frazier has decided to write the novel in a strange fashion, apparently attempting to create atmosphere. This has led to several strange choices: an overbearing, leaden tone to the prose, and the omission of quotation marks in the text. The latter leads to passages like the following:The light soon fell too grey to read. A pair of bobwhites called their identical three-word messages back and forth from the field to the woods. Ruby rose and said, I better get on.The last four words of that paragraph are spoken. What's the point to deleting the quotation marks and separating them from the rest of the text? It looks to me like the author is attempting to show how literary he is or something. If a paragraph begins with dialog, he starts it with a dash, but otherwise, you have to pay very careful attention. There's a passage later in the book (too long to reproduce here) where you're not sure where Inman stops speaking and the narrator starts, though Inman is I in one part of the paragraph and he in another.Then there's the issue of &quot;authenticity.&quot; Frazier clearly knows something about the Civil War, and he's done some research which has led him to make some interesting choices in the novel: the way characters speak, the things they carry, the opinions they express. One very interesting thing (which the author only touches on briefly a couple of times) is that Inman doesn't idolize Lee, and admires Longstreet more. That's not something you would get from most history books (though it's entirely possible, especially for a soldier not from Virginia) and it's refreshing a bit.On the other hand, there's the issue of the guns. In the first passage of the book where we actually see the name of a firearm, it's a Whitworth sniper rifle. It turns out that the gun is (apparently) owned by a Home Guard soldier who winds up chasing Inman. Whitworths were extremely rare, delicate, expensive weapons, and the idea of one in the hands of a Home Guard part-time soldier is something of a stretch of imagination for someone who knows something about the Civil War. For one thing, the ammunition would be hard to obtain (you couldn't make your own, as you could with many other weapons of the era) and for another it would be very difficult to care for, and you certainly wouldn't lean it against a wall outside a store (where we see it first) so that someone could fiddle with it or steal it. Later, we learn that Inman himself has a LeMat, an exotic pistol known as the &quot;grapeshot gun&quot; because of its shotgun barrel mounted below the regular pistol barrel. The author knows enough to make Inman's one of the better ones made in Britain, and though they were rare, it's not that much of a stretch. But later, when we meet the villain, the leader of the Home Guard, he has a Spencer repeating rifle. By now I've lost all hope of this being realistic, and the Spencer finished things off for me. Again, ammunition would have been an issue (the Spencer fires copper cartridges, which the South couldn't manufacture) and those that were captured were put in the hands of sharpshooters with carefully hoarded ammunition.The novel does have a weary, careworn air about it that suggests that the characters have been through three years of war, and that's at least authentic. As I've shown, some of the details are suspect, though, so it's safe to say this: the more one knows about the Civil War in particular, the less authentic this novel will seem.The novel has many pretentions though, attempting to be very literary and sophisticated. I believe it mostly fails, but others here think it succeeded. The parallels to Homer are obvious, and if you don't get them yourself, the author helpfully has Ada read the Oddyssey to Ruby early in the book, to make sure you get the reference yourself. Might as well have hit me over the head with Homer himself.I don't like writing that's self-conciously sophisticated. I've read Conrad, Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Jane Austen, Chaim Potok, Patrick O'Brian. I'm not a fan of modern literature, and since I suppose this book is aspiring to fit into that category, along with Updike and Vonnegut and so forth. I wish the author luck, but I'm not going to read anything else by the man. This was a big disappointment.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,,,6/13,1.0,1073433600,Agonizingly Tedious.,Individuals are obviously polarized regarding Cold Mountain. Reading it was as boring a chore as I've encountered in a long while with no redemption at this novel's end. Perhaps the movie is better; one can only hope.,,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A1AG4LMWW9WHDL,E. Maselli,4/10,2.0,1077494400,Long and boring,"I know this book received lots of critical accolades, and I consider myself a learned, well-read person - but I could not get through this story. I have owned the book since 1997, tried to read it 3 or 4 times, and never got past the first chapter. I finally forced myself to read it prior to the movie coming out, and I could barely finish it. Nothing happens! A guy walks away from a hospital and heads home, while a woman he barely knows tries to scrape together an existence during the Civil War. It is inconceivable to me that, even during a more innocent time, anyone could or would sustain enough passion for 4 years to have him make the long trek home based on a total of &quot;100 words&quot; spoken to each other (actually, the &quot;100 words&quot; comment may be from the movie, not the book.) I really wanted to like this (and actually liked the movie), but, unfortunately I thought the book was awful.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,,,3/8,4.0,1078272000,Comparison between Book and Movie- Cold Mountian (Part II),"""When three crows harried a hawk across the sky, Ruby expressed her great respect for the normally reviled crow, finding much worthy of emulation in their outlook on life. She noted with disapproval that many a bird would die rather than eat any but food it relishes. Crows will relish what presents itself. She admired their keenness of wit, lack of pridefulness, love of practical jokes, slyness in a fight. All of these she saw, as making up the genius of crow, which was a kind of willed mastery over what she assumed was a natural inclination toward bile and melancholy, as evidenced by its drear plumage.--We might all take instruction from crow, Ruby said...""Ruby clearly can relate the trials she and Ada are going through to the crow. Of course, both of them, epically Ada, would enjoy being able to relax and lie around lazily doing only what they please, but they must now resort to the less pleasurable tasks in order to stay alive.Inman also encounters crows on his journey, and has the same opinion of them. In the film, the black crows simply represent death. While black crows were minor symbolism in the book, they become major symbolism in the movie. They represent Inman's death, though this is really not apparent until the end of the movie. When Ada finds herself looking for her future in the images down Sally Swagner's well, she sees Inman walking surrounded by black crows. She believes this to be Inman waking home, but it is actually Inman immediately before his death, right before he stumbles and falls into the snow. At the end of the movie, right after Inman falls from his horse, Ada hears a crow call out and runs, knowing that it must have to do with Inman. She then sees the vision she saw down the well, the black crows surrounding Inman as he struggles to walk toward her. Later, when she is holding his head in her arms, the crow once again calls out as Inman takes his last breath. The way the crow connects with Inman's death really impressed me when watching this movie, it acted as a guide through the entire scene and was an excellent decision on Minghella's part.Although I preferred the film to the book, one of the few things in the movie that bothered me was casting Nicole Kidman as Ada. Now don't get me wrong, Ms. Kidman is an incredibly talented and beautiful actress, but she simply was not right for the part. There were several times in the movie when she was standing next to Rene Zellweger's Ruby, who was appropriately all scuffed up and dirty from farm work, and there is Nicole looking like she walked off the cover of Vanity Fair-The Civil War Issue. I understood from the book that Ada was supposed to be pretty, but I thought that the film's costume and make-up might have taken that too far. Indeed, in one of the last scenes, Ada is out in the woods in ""rugged old britches of Monroe's"" where she is starving and cold, helping Ruby to bury a dead man. But Ada looks as if she just stepped off a fashionable street in Manhattan. I had pictured Ada as pretty, yet a little rough around the edges from all of her war-years work with Ruby on the farm. I had also pictured her as she is described in the book, with curly brown hair, slightly tanned skin from her work outside, and not-so-brilliant blue eyes. The movie's decision to glamorize Ada definitely took away from the storyline; she was without a smudge of dirt on her face the entire movie.Aside from this one casting mishap, I was impressed with every single character in the entire movie. My favorite actress in the movie was Rene Zellweger. When she was on the screen, all I could think of was, ""wow, she is incredibly talented."" It seemed to me that she had jumped inside my head, stolen the character of Ruby, and developed her even more than I had imagined while reading the book.I also liked the character of the ""blind man"" in the beginning of the film. The blind man has a very small part in the book/movie, but pulled through to be one of my favorite characters. His eyes were constantly peering of into the distance, or so they seemed, as if he was looking into the wise tellings of some ancient proverb as he talked to Inman, giving him wise advice in the film. That was a scene my mind had imagined when reading the book, and I was very happy to see it on the screen. The blind man had just a few lines, but he still stole the scene away from Jude Law, a hard thing to do.So, in conclusion, I must say that both movie and book are amazing, but the movie pulls off something that the book does not. It permanently stamped images into my memory, and I found myself rethinking them often during the day when my mind starts to wander. The film did more did more than just breathe life into the book, which now seems dull without it. So, I beg of you, grab the popcorn and watch Cold Mountain-it is definitely an experience you won't soon forget.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,AZOXOWED6WCJU,Esme,4/10,1.0,1083196800,too much drama,"I was recommended this book for many reasons. Many said of the beautiful writing, the character development, the writer's ability to transport you into the Civil War era. They were all liars.I am an avid reader, and it takes a pretty bad book for me to stop reading it. Well, Cold Mountain was just such a book. It took 4 tries to even get halfway through. There are not many redeeming qualities, so giving it one star is being generous.The story of Inman, the escaped prisoner making his way back to Ada, had the potential to be a powerful narrative about the human spirit and the possible rehabilitation. Instead, it became a monotonous shuffle through Inman's small mind. He is making a journey of a lifetime, putting himself back together, shouldn't it read as such? Instead, its a depressing and unneccesarily descriptive exploration through the wild. As bad as Inman's tale is, Ada's is even worse. She is spoiled debutante who suddenly finds herself alone. Boo hoo. Have some fortitude and take pride in your independence. The only bright spot of hte story is Ruby, the farm girl who comes to live with and help Ada. But as good as her story could have been, she is also a bit over the top drama. The love story between Inman and Ada seems contrived and a bit ridiculous, even for a fiction novel. I was sadly disappointed, Cold Mountain is just a cold fish.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,Henry Platte,7/9,5.0,1083456000,Immense,"The contents of this novel are well represented by that huge, misty landscape on the cover. Cold Mountain seems to come from another era, one where authors weren't forced into the straightjacket of pithy sentences and cheap wit; it's reminiscent of Twain or Robert Penn Warren, huge, sprawling and thoughtful; there's something almost miraculous about it.Some people may have been dissapointed with the novel because it isn't really about two of the things that it was reported to be about. It isn't pedantic historic fiction, a la 'The Killer Angels,' and not meant to shed light on the Civil War as a histroical phenomenon. It also isn't much as a retelling of the Odyssey. The underlying theme - looking for home and encountering obstacles - is the same, and there may be some resemblances between the obstacles that Ulysses and Inman face, but the heritage isn't noteworthy in any way.What Cold Mountain does have is an endless depth of innovation in theme and style and character. It manages somehow to shift from a rousing adventure story to a contented and charming chronicle of farm life, to an eerie, sort of Sartrean mediation on life and morality, to an exploration of Southern folklore and small personal history. You can feel the author's talent stretching the bounds of the subject matter sometimes. He wants and has the ability to write about everything, from the greatest person to the smallest, from a gruesome battle to dinner in an inn. It's so eclectic, even, that it begins to approach a fault, but Frazier ties things together nicely using the theme of the war. Early on, Robert E. Lee is criticized for his smug 'It's a good thing war is so terrible; otherwise we might grow to like it.' Inman reflects that for a man like Lee, noble and dramatic, war is really not terrible, and that he has no compunction about sending 'lesser' men to die. Later on, this malcious spirit of greatness takes form as General Teague, captain of the southern home defense force, a real Bond villian of a character. The first couple of times he appears, complete with sidekicks, hammy dialogue and gut-splattering violence, are so brilliantly calculated; later, when he tracks down and confronts Inman, it plays out in such an intriguingly symbolic way, bringing the novel to a satisfactory close. There's a point where, reflecting on the death of a scoundrel, Inman thinks something like: 'There was no sense of redemption or nobility about it...neither did it seem like a deserved or justified end. It had simply happened,' and that seems to be the theme. Cold Mountain tries to encompass almost everything in life, and succeeds more than you would think possible.",,

In other words, the actual art of the word in this novel is superb, but I was not overly impressed with the story. When I started this book, I was so very impressed with the author's voice, as I continued on to the story I was left wanting for more content. I felt like many of the best moments of the books were with the transient characters, which was a shame. Ada, Ruby, and Inman seem to be lacking depth and it seems to me there could have been so much more done with them. In any event, for this first novel, it's excellent, far far better than I could ever hope to write, but still, I was wanting for more.",,
B000GVI7JY,Cold Mountain,,AWUUMER0F3WF4,Sheryl Fechter,1/1,5.0,1330560000,A Hauntingly Beautiful Novel Of Love And Yearning During The Civil War...,"I couldn't imagine a more difficult time in our history than the Civil War. The north and the south torn apart in regret and loss. The story of ""Cold Mountain"" brings this into view through the love of a Confederate soldier, Inman for a pastor's daughter, Ada Monroe. The only thing that they can truly own is an extreme yearning for each other, for the love they had just begun when the war shattered their dreams.The tale is told in the most descriptive way including; the people of Cold Mountain, the region afflicted, the music, the harshness of starvation and regrowth, and especially, for me, the eloquence of the beautiful language during the time.Ada comes from a much more refined life in Charleston and along with her father moves to Cold Mountain, N.C.. Inman lives and works there as a carpenter, or as he puts it, ""I work with wood"". As is so often with a blockbuster movie adapted from a novel, as with this one, there are so many situations and beautiful conversations that are not said on film.In this lovely book you will be romanced into the more simple and complicated time of the Civil war and it's affect on the people of the north and south, predominately those of the Mountain. Although reading the novel with Inman's epic journey to return to his Ada, you will be introduced to a multi-faceted people. These including northern soldiers and people everywhere who are willing to aid Inman and those who are not so inclined. Inman is never truly able to know of whom he may give his trust to, as the journey is harrowing and both sides are looking to retrieve him.During Inman's incredible journey, Ada is introduced to experiences she was never raised to handle alone. Out of money, food, help...Ada is forced to come out of herself and learn how to run a farm. This is done by the fortunate introduction of Ruby, who comes to her aid and seems to 'whip her into shape' quickly. Refusing to be a servant to Ada, Ruby is a co-owner of the farm and Ada works tirelessly along side of her.Through all sorts of perilous happenings, they forge on together as a team. The whole time, Ada never loses sight of Inman though no words are passed between them for years, with exception to the one single letter of hundreds sent by Ada that Inman does receive. Thus the reverberating words, ""come back to me"" are said and spurns on an epic tale of love for Inman and Ada.The pages of this novel are so perfectly written that they were often reread by me, just to read the lovely language spoken; the love story itself, the mountain people, the regional qualities, the music explained and the nostalgia of that day. Don't put this one up on the bookshelf, leave it on a tabletop to pick up and transport yourself to another place and time via a few read pages.",,

While reading the book, sometimes it was hard to follow what the character was trying to say. Because, the book was set in the early 1900's, they talked with a myriad amount of slang and was difficult to read. There was also some foul and offensive language.I liked the book because it was very descriptive with its actions. When the author was describing a situation I could picture it down to the last detail. When you can picture what you are reading it makes things more enjoyable. Each character had their own distinct personality that stuck with them throughout the entire book. One thing that I didn't like about the book was the ending. After the biggest event in the book it suddenly came to an end. I wish the author would have went a little further before bringing the book to a halt.This story is full of emotions.

All of these are descriptions of a novel I recently read by the name, ""Of Mice and Men"" by a well-known author John Steinbeck. I would rate this book 8 on a scale of 10 because I learned so much about the way we treat others and their reactions, told through a man who has had much experience with the subject. Lennie, a big dumb, jock, was born slow, mentaly incapable of reacting to daily life. After George, a caring yet riggid man befriends him early in child hood, the two become traveling partners and best buddies. George becomes weary of Lennie's childish ways and misachievous antics, which continually causes the pair trouble and forces them to skip around the country.""That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a quarter mile.

If he finds out what a crazy ... you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk we're set. Ya got that?""This story is special because all aspects of diction, from all characters are described in simple English. The story had no useless vocabulary or pointless explaining, just a plain dexcription of the people. The story also uses vivid imagery when George tells Lennie about how they were going to own a ranch and Lennie can raise rabbits. Steinbeck reveals the simle truth about racism, dgradation, and jelousy. People in the book are struggling to overcome an obstacle that holds them back. At their final stop, they meet all types of people, which teach them about diversity and how to deal with it. The story's resolution reveals how humans deal with the sorrow of our society. The outcome may shock us, yet it seems just in it's own irony. I sincerely suggest this book to those looking to explore humanity and to those who would like to know what friendship and loyalty is and if you liked ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" or ""The Catcher in the Rye"", you will like this book because I, Jamil Faruque a student of Falls Church HS, have read both of these books which shows similarities with ""Of Mice and Men""",,

I would rate this book 8 on a scale of 10 because I learned so much about the way we treat others and their reactions, told through a man who has had much experience with the subject. Lennie, a big dumb, jock, was born slow, mentaly incapable of reacting to daily life. After George, a caring yet riggid man befriends him early in child hood, the two become traveling partners and best buddies. George becomes weary of Lennie's childish ways and misachievous antics, which continually causes the pair trouble and forces them to skip around the country.""That ranch we're goin' to is right down there about a quarter mile. We're gonna go in an' see the boss. Now, look-- I'll give him the work tickets, but you ain't gonna say a word. You jus' stand there and son't say nothing. If he finds out what a crazy ... you are, we won't get no job, but if he sees ya work before he hears ya talk we're set. Ya got that?""This story is special because all aspects of diction, from all characters are described in simple English. The story had no useless vocabulary or pointless explaining, just a plain dexcription of the people. The story also uses vivid imagery when George tells Lennie about how they were going to own a ranch and Lennie can raise rabbits. Steinbeck reveals the simle truth about racism, dgradation, and jelousy. People in the book are struggling to overcome an obstacle that holds them back. At their final stop, they meet all types of people, which teach them about diversity and how to deal with it. The story's resolution reveals how humans deal with the sorrow of our society. The outcome may shock us, yet it seems just in it's own irony. I sincerely suggest this book to those looking to explore humanity and to those who would like to know what friendship and loyalty is and if you liked ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" or ""The Catcher in the Rye"", you will like this book because I, Jamil Faruque a student of Falls Church HS, have read both of these books which shows similarities with ""Of Mice and Men""",,
B000GYWPTE,Of Mice and Men,,,,3/5,5.0,1104364800,Friendships,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is an attractive book about two men named George and Lennie. It is also interesting to read because it talks about how George and Lennie develop a common friendship among each other. George is short and takes care of Lennie because Lennie has a mind of a child. They both use to work in a weed but they had to leave because of an incident that had occur. They went to a new weed in Solidad where there they had many dreams ahead. In the new weed they met new people which made George and Lennie Friendships grow even more. For example Lennie has been in a fight with curley, George told him to fight back and so he did which, led Lennie to breaking Curley's hand.Even though the ending is sad, George and Lennie friendship can insipires everyone because they look out for each other.Even though Lennie is a big and huge he is a kind person.This is an excellent book writen ny John Steinbeck with a sad ending. Through out the pages you can see how much George cares about Lennie. I enjoyed reading this book and it has inspired me to have stronger friendship with my friends. Therefore I would like to recommend this book to those whom are interested in reading books about friendships.",,

B000GYWPTE,Of Mice and Men,,,,0/0,3.0,1168387200,Ariel F. student at MLMS,"When two hobos Lennie and George set off to a new town in Salinas, California with hopes of fulfilling their dream of owning their own farm, things don't go as easy as planned. The two get a job on a farm and go though many obstacles; the main one Curly's wife. That's how all the action begins. Author John Steinbeck pulls you deep inside this story taking place during The Great Depression, and keeps you laughing by the realistic dialogue of all the characters, in the novel ""Of Mice and Men.""Lennie and George get into trouble often by Lennie's uncontrollable strength. He doesn't seem to realize when he's hurting something or someone because of his slow mentality. George is his care taker and watches over him like a father. Even though he would like to be alone he feels like he has no choice but to be with Lennie. Sometimes George gets annoyed by how Lennie says ""An' rabbits, George."" (Steinbeck, page 57) whenever he talks about the farm that they're going to have.This book is so exciting and enjoyable that it makes you want to jump ahead to the end. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel like they're on a adventure and who doesn't mind strong language.",,

But it did not move me as much as the best books that I have read.The best thing that I can say about OM&M; is that it is a book that you want to read. John Steinbeck's protagonists, George and Lennie, are so vividly drawn that they ""come to life"" for the reader. As a result, I found that I cared about both men's fates and I cheered for them to succeed.Steinbeck also does a good job of crafting vivid descriptions of the grubby conditions in which George and Lennie live their lives; readers will find it easy to picture the scenes that Steinbeck describes. OM&M; contains several strong scenes. The scene in which the men debate whether to shoot Candy's dog is powerful and important to Steinbeck's overall message. The opening scene in which George and Lennie walk down the dusty road toward the ranch also contains many memorable images and some good dialogue.In other ways, I thought that OM&M; was lacking. OM&M; is depressingly unsubtle. Steinbeck incessantly hammers away at his themes. For instance, Steinbeck makes the point that Lennie does NOT like to fight so many times that I lost count. Another overworn point is that the men dream of living on land that they own. Steinbeck seems to have worried that his readers were not sufficiently intelligent to draw the conclusions that he wanted them to draw. He attempted to compensate through redundancy.More damagingly, Steinbeck sets up a simplistic universe in which good, strong workers struggle against heartless bosses. Unlike George and Lennie, the people that they work for are sloppily-drawn caricatures. The fact that Steinbeck describes one character only as ""Curley's wife"" provides an idea of the slapdash manner in which Steinbeck draws the ""villains."" I don't want to include a spoiler in my review, but I believe that OM&M; would have been more powerful if ""Curley's wife"" had been less of a caricature. Had she been even moderately sympathetic, OM&M; would challenge its readers to answer more-difficult questions. Steinbeck's immunity to nuance drains the power and realism from OM&M.;Finally, OM&M;'s last chapter includes a scene in which Lennie has surreal visions. This is a daring tactic. Steinbeck uses it to try to illustrate Lennie's internal struggle. It is only partially successful as it introduces a jarring shift in the perspective Steinbeck uses in the rest of the book. Lennie's visions are interesting, but the manner in which Steinbeck presents the visions makes the reader aware of Steinbeck's overly-heavy hand.OM&M; is a good, quick (118-page) read.

Steinbeck's strong moral viewpoint and incredible prose come together in a terrific novel.The Good: Of Mice and Men is succinct with a strong moral viewpoint. The migrant workers envision a society where they can have their basic needs fulfilled and work their own land. Their needs are simple, yet they cannot be consistently fulfilled because of their position at the very bottom of the social ladder. As with The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck here concerns himself with the well-being of the worst off Americans. While the basic economic and social system seems to be set against the migrant workers, the workers themselves envision a world where they can live together and share the fruits of the earth they till.Steinbeck proves himself once again to be a master of unassuming, delicate language. He describes the Salinas Valley in such concrete, yet haunting words. The characters are so vividly real. Their dialogue is so natural and unassuming. The friendship between George and Lennie becomes so real in the text that the ending it simply heartbreaking. Steinbeck is simply a master crafter of the English language.The Bad: Some people might be put off by the sad ending. I do not consider it a drawback. In fact, it is the only coherent ending the novel could have had.The Bottom Line: Of Mice and Men is a novel that shouldn't be missed.See more of my reviews @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com",,

As other reviewers have noted, the novel is a quick read and pretty digestible. However, I am disturbed -- personally -- by the focus on gender-specific worlds. For example, Kathryn continually remarks on the &quot;masculinity&quot; of the pilot's world and how men are always in control. Gender, as we know, is a social construct and Shreve's novel only undermines such thinking.

The book is mainly about her state of mind and involves only a few other characters: her daughter, a sympathetic representative of the airline who helps her adjust to the news and gradually provides more information, and her step-mother who mainly helps take care of the daughter during the event. And of course the husband, who is revealed through stories about their past.I found this book readable and interesting, but I didn't find myself deeply involved in the character, Kathryn, or even the story. As I learned about her relationship with her husband, the later stories seem inconsistent with the earlier ones and I found it hard to believe Kathryn would have had the impressions of her marriage she conveyed at first. The relationships with the other characters (especially her daughter and mother) were sketched only lightly. Despite the mystery aspects of the book, I didn't find it especially compelling.

I give this book two stars instead of proverbial one for a few reasons. Primarily, I believe the Anita Shreve has the power to be a great writer, but instead of writing well, she writes horrible books such as The Pilot's Wife to appease the average pleasure reader and make millions of dollars. Secondly, this book isn't absolutely horrible, but it is near there. Finally, she made an effort. Two hundred ninety three pages is a lot of work, be it good or bad.Brief synopsis: a woman finds out that her supposedly normal husband who works as an airline pilot on overseas routes has a life that she is oblivious to and regrets not knowing about.I read this book in a few hours on a rainy day. My day became even worse after I finished it. The nostalgic thoughts are placed horribly and are not justified anywhere. She simply puts something dramatic at the end of each to compensate for the lack of good writing.

B000HKLROQ,Middlesex,,A206X6OFCQ6VDX,Andrew Stern,0/3,4.0,1036972800,"Middlesex, by Jeffrey Eugenides","Middlesex is Eugenides second novel, following the success of The Virgin Suicides in 1993.First, let&#146;s get one thing out of the way: the protagonist in this book is a hermaphrodite. Cal Stephanides has a penis and a vagina and that&#146;s, well, kind of creepy. At the same time, it provides a dramatic pull that keeps us going in a sort of guilty urgency to get to the &#145;dirty parts&#146; &#150; that is, we all want to know exactly how the plumbing works. In this way the novel is similar to Katherine Dunn&#146;s Geek Love, which also plays on our morbid curiosity but does so with empathy and care for her characters.The writing in Middlesex is fresh and provocative, if not as audacious as Dave Eggers or as graceful as Jonathan Franzen. Eugenides proves himself a capable storyteller in his sophomore novel. Structurally, the narrative has three parts: the story of Cal&#146;s ancestors immigrating from Greece, Cal&#146;s adolescent coming-of-age story, and his middle-aged love story. The latter is told in the present tense and layered on top of the first two, doled out in installments during breaks in the action; it&#146;s an effective way to weave the narrative together and bring out the novel&#146;s themes.Ultimately, Middlesex is about identity in modern society: cultural identity, gender identity, and personal identity in a relationship. Perhaps that&#146;s why Cal&#146;s coming-of-age story is the most compelling; adolescence is after all the crucible where our identity is formed. For Cal &#150; an adolescent with one foot on each side of cultural and gender gaps &#150; it is no less than terrifying.In Eugenides&#146; hands, Cal is an incredibly powerful instrument to examine how we think about ourselves. The choices that the protagonist makes reveal the arbitrary nature of things we hold sacrosanct. What, after all, does it mean to be a man or a woman? What does it mean to be an American or a Greek? The lessons here cannot be reduced to banal aphorisms. We&#146;re not all the same on the inside. We&#146;re not products purely of nature or of nurture. The struggle that we all make to carve out our place in the world is lovingly rendered in this enjoyable, if quirky, novel.",,

The heavy hand of the author distracts from his vivid characters, moving plot, and gorgeous prose. The first half is amazing and memorable, but at about the half-way point, Eugneides seems to lose focus. At that point, the author's desire to instruct his readers seems to trump his interest in the characters. What had been a character-driven plot becomes something like a set of essays in which the author is the star while the characters are used to illustrate his ideas. For example, most readers would grasp the meaning of the title without being hit over the head with it by Eugenides's making it part of the story. The book becomes less interesting as one plows through it. Perhaps when a writer is this talented, editors leave them to their own devices.

What this means is that although he was born and raised as a female (due to his anatomy), he actually possesses the hormones that make him male.The novel starts with Lefty and Desdemona Stephinedes who are brother and sister-they flee Greece after the Turkish invasion and reinvent themselves as husband and wife in America where no one knows of their past (save the cousin they are living with). Their son marries his cousin, thus keeping the recessive 5AR gene in the family, and gives birth to Callie/Cal.The story starts with the establishment of the Stephinedes family in Detroit and gives a great mini-lesson on the history of urbanization and the roots of the civil rights movement as well as family history. Once Callie is born, the story becomes very moving as he grows and enters puberty. When he fails to develop normally as a female, his struggle to identify and accept himself is well-written. The turning points are his relationship with the &quot;Obscure Object&quot; (his first female relationship) and sessions with the gender doctor which ultimately determine his choice of which life to live.Great book, highly recommended!",,

Even though the frequent sex scenes made me a bit queasy and I found myself coming to hate the seemingly stupid decisions of the characters I feel that they are a very accurate interpretation of the average person set in an un-average situation such as being faced with the fact that you are a hermaphrodite. I believe that this book has acquired so many accolades because of the fact that it's characters are normal people who make stupid decisions, and constant mistakes. Even though it pains me to say so, they are realistic and accurately express the views and feelings of the mainstream.

Marren ""jtm497""",1/4,5.0,1072915200,Fiction truer than Fact,"Jeffrey Eugenides' ""Middlesex"" explores the mystery of gender in this sprawling family epic about, yes, a hemaphrodite. Don't be put off by the seeming oddness of the subject matter--this is a beautifully written story of a family and a very sensitive exploration of what it really means to be a man or a woman.In this novel, the discovery of a grandparent's long-buried secret unlocks the key to the person Cal/Callie is and prompts the writing of the Stephanides story as Cal/Callie imagines it must have been. Eugenides is a fine writer and I knew by the middle of the second page that I was hooked.The tale spans the 20th century, starting in post WWI Greece and the constant war between the Greeks and Turks. The story of Desdemona and Lefty's escape to the new world is gripping and suspenseful, and the relationship between them is totally believable. Forward to Detroit at the dawn of the age of the motorcar--we think of Ford and his assembly line as a magnificent innovation, but until now I'd never paused to consider the terrible price paid by the workers in the age before labor laws and safety standards, as well as by Detroit itself before anyone even thought about a thing called the ""environment."" As the story of this Greek American family unfolds the author takes us on some interesting detours, as many young novelists seem to do these days, to the world of bootlegging and illegal bars, the Detroit race riots, the Greek Orthodox church, the growth of fast food chains, and the earliest rumblings of Black Power.It's a credit to the author that Cal/Callie remains the focus of all this, a thoughtful, confused teenager having no idea that anything was wrong but knowing somehow that nothing was right. The relationship between Callie and the ""Object"" was as sensitive a picture of teenage sexual exploration as I've read. And the suspense of waiting for Callie to discover her true nature made it hard to put the book down.This book reminded me of ""As Nature Made Him,"" a non-fiction account of a child with very similar gender identity issues, who went through the surgery to make him an anatomically correct girl but still couldn't suppress his true gender. And yet I was struck how ""Middlesex"" presented what I think is a much truer picture of the inner thoughts of an adolescent dealing with puberty in this utterly confusing situation. I loved how Eugenides portrayed Cal/Callie as a blend of the feminine and masculine, as we all are--in this case the blend was just so much closer to 50-50.Physicians specializing in the gender field come in for some tough criticism in both ""Middlesex"" and ""As Nature Made Him."" In both cases the thinking of the time on the nature-nuture question gave more weight to the nuture part of the equation than medicine does today. Unfortunately the physicians here seemed to be as interested in validating their theories as in deciding the right path for the child. The theory may have changed, and one certainly hopes the way Callie was treated, as an interesting specimen, isn't the case today either.""Middlesex"" won a well-deserved Pulitzer.

Middlesex is both flawlessly written and can't-put-it-down exciting to read. It is truly an epic tale.The concept of the book-- a hermaphrodite's coming-of-age complete with crazy big fat Greek family and the accompanying chaos of their collective history and present-- is beyond intriguing, and something that certainly hasn't been explored much in the past. Moreover, Eugenides has the humble acuity to take his creative idea to the next level and beyond, to stretch it into a gripping human tale of passion and uncertainty and adventure and just pure, raw, exhilerating LIFE. Eugenides is fearless in his depictions of everything-- from a surprisingly understandable incestuous love affair to the extruciatingly bloody Hellenic genocide to a fractured family life in the heart of Detroit to an x-rated freak show in the slums of San Francisco-- and yet he somehow immerses the reader in each and every situation, allows her to feel for each and every character. In particular is the narrator, Cal.Cal is the novel's protagonist and focal point and yet the story swirls out to explain why Cal is the way he/she is from every angle, scientific and emotional and intellectual. In creating Cal, Eugenides has proven himself a literary genious. Cal's voice is the definition of pitch-perfect, and reads like the voice of your best friend (if your best friend spoke with highly imaginative and insightful intelligence brimming with alluring imagery and sharp wit)...Middlesex is its own microcosm; it has everything, and Eugenides fuses it all together into a big beautiful masterpiece that you want to stare at long after you realize you should stop staring.Conclusion?

Although his tale has a decidedly unusual bend, I think that anyone who has heard the tales their grandparents and great-grandparents have told about coming to America will enjoy this book, regardless of their nationality. Much of the story is universal in its description of the European immigration experience and subsequent assimilation into the American way of life. Eugenides characterizations are three dimensional and sympathetic, and the story is both engrossing and entertaining.Editors might have curtailed a bit of Eugenides description of the historic struggles of Greece and Turkey, both past and present, but regardless, the tale flowed and bloomed. An interesting technique that Eugenides used was to sometimes revert to a third person observation of main character, Cal. It was an effective way to show how the character felt divorced from her own body.- C.A. Wulff, www.yelodoggie.com",,

It's flush with history that's relevant to the characters' experiences and that brings a little reality to some unbelievable plot moments. The story idea is new - Calliope is the most entertaining gender-defiant person since Myra Breckinridge. Yes, there's a lot to like about this book. But, the lengthy, albeit well-researched medical science, makes for laborious reading. And, except for Calliope, the center of the story, the characters are pretty flat. Although the adult Cal tells much of the story from her (now his) childhood perspective, I never heard the child's voice. As in most real-life family situations, there is dark humor here; yet, there is too little laughter to take Middlesex beyond an awareness that it's fiction.",,

B000HKR9FW,Mere Christianity,,A1HAREI9MW1UTH,Arno Arrak,32/78,1.0,1157241600,Moral Law Is Naturally Selected,"This book has its origins in a series of wartime lectures that the author gave over BBC in 1943 which were later collated into three booklets and finally rendered into the present volume. The author, who says he was once an atheist, fancies that he can convert others into Christianity with his pop talk about the ""Moral Law"" or ""The Law of Right and Wrong"" he pulls out of himself. God embedded a knowledge of it into human nature he says and to him it is as real as the laws of physics except that we can disobey it. The first five chapters are devoted to this Moral Law and then he goes on to some basic Christian ethics. Included are the four cardinal virtues -- Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude -- as well as the three theological virtues -- Faith, Hope and Charity. His defense of God for allowing much evil in the world is that God gave us free will and we ourselves messed up our lives. That is a real copout for a supposedly all-good, omnipotent being. If the Nazi and Communist mass murders leave him unmoved, what chance is there that he will interfere about the woes of an individual human being? Although not married Lewis lived with an older woman (mother of his fallen comrade) for more than a decade. In discussing Christian marriage, however, he speaks of ""the monstrosity of intercourse outside the marriage."" and goes on to suggest that ""divorce is something like cutting up a living body."" Also, in marriage, ""Christian wives promise to obey their husband"" and ""...the man is said to be the `head'."" For those already converted or on the verge of being converted all that sermonizing does have a morale-boosting quality, for it tells them just what they want to hear. And what does conversion do for you? ""Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect - perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, and immortality.The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment."" In plain language, you have to die first in order to collect your just rewards as a Christian. Or, like it says in ""The Preacher and the Slave,"" ""...you get pie in the sky when you die."" However, Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, read the book when a preacher whose advice he sought handed it to him and became a famous convert. You really have to want to believe badly and close your eyes to all that unreality which is part of the package to accept such delusions but Collins manages to do it. He in particular should know that modern science has found the physical basis for that moral instinct upon which Lewis builds his case. Quite simply, we are a social species and evolution has provided us with social instincts necessary to hold society together. In ""The Science of Good and Evil"" Michael Shermer has worked out some consequences of evolutionary ethics. Michael Gazzaniga, speaking of brain scans in ""The Ethical Brain,"" points out that whenever a person is willing to act on a moral belief the emotional part of his brain has become active while considering the moral question at hand. In ""Moral Minds"" Marc D. Hauser introduces the idea of an evolved moral grammar, analogous to that which we possess for language and of which we are not aware of but which is capable of rapid ethical decision making. Physical damage to some parts of the forebrain, as happened to Phineas Gage in 1848 and to others since, will destroy all moral inhibitions we have. The latter fact is proof that it is a properly functioning brain, not some spiritual essence that is responsible for moral behavior. Further proof comes from the observation that autists lack emotions, including any sort of moral sense as a result of their brain defects. All this of course is knowledge Lewis could not have had but which Collins should have been aware of. Atheism is quickly dismissed by Lewis as being ""too simple"" (which says nothing about its validity). And his treatment of evolution is equally cavalier: ""By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us."" This materialist view is not for him for he prefers the religious view -- the view that behind the universe is something like a mind which is conscious and has purposes. And one of its purposes is to produce creatures like itself that have minds, which means us. He does not tell us how he came to know all this or why we should take his word for it and simply says that trying to disprove it by ""science in the ordinary sense"" (whatever that may mean) is impossible. Further reading reveals that not only is his science out of date but that he also makes a joke of it: ""Every scientific statement...in the long run really means something like, "" I pointed the telescope at such and such part of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,"" or, ""I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so.""

B000HKR9FW,Mere Christianity,,A1HAREI9MW1UTH,Arno Arrak,32/78,1.0,1157241600,Moral Law Is Naturally Selected,"This book has its origins in a series of wartime lectures that the author gave over BBC in 1943 which were later collated into three booklets and finally rendered into the present volume. The author, who says he was once an atheist, fancies that he can convert others into Christianity with his pop talk about the ""Moral Law"" or ""The Law of Right and Wrong"" he pulls out of himself. God embedded a knowledge of it into human nature he says and to him it is as real as the laws of physics except that we can disobey it. The first five chapters are devoted to this Moral Law and then he goes on to some basic Christian ethics. Included are the four cardinal virtues -- Prudence, Temperance, Justice and Fortitude -- as well as the three theological virtues -- Faith, Hope and Charity. His defense of God for allowing much evil in the world is that God gave us free will and we ourselves messed up our lives. That is a real copout for a supposedly all-good, omnipotent being. If the Nazi and Communist mass murders leave him unmoved, what chance is there that he will interfere about the woes of an individual human being? Although not married Lewis lived with an older woman (mother of his fallen comrade) for more than a decade. In discussing Christian marriage, however, he speaks of ""the monstrosity of intercourse outside the marriage."" and goes on to suggest that ""divorce is something like cutting up a living body."" Also, in marriage, ""Christian wives promise to obey their husband"" and ""...the man is said to be the `head'."" For those already converted or on the verge of being converted all that sermonizing does have a morale-boosting quality, for it tells them just what they want to hear. And what does conversion do for you? ""Those who put themselves in His hands will become perfect, as He is perfect - perfect in love, wisdom, joy, beauty, and immortality.The change will not be completed in this life, for death is an important part of the treatment."" In plain language, you have to die first in order to collect your just rewards as a Christian. Or, like it says in ""The Preacher and the Slave,"" ""...you get pie in the sky when you die."" However, Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, read the book when a preacher whose advice he sought handed it to him and became a famous convert. You really have to want to believe badly and close your eyes to all that unreality which is part of the package to accept such delusions but Collins manages to do it. He in particular should know that modern science has found the physical basis for that moral instinct upon which Lewis builds his case. Quite simply, we are a social species and evolution has provided us with social instincts necessary to hold society together. In ""The Science of Good and Evil"" Michael Shermer has worked out some consequences of evolutionary ethics. Michael Gazzaniga, speaking of brain scans in ""The Ethical Brain,"" points out that whenever a person is willing to act on a moral belief the emotional part of his brain has become active while considering the moral question at hand. In ""Moral Minds"" Marc D. Hauser introduces the idea of an evolved moral grammar, analogous to that which we possess for language and of which we are not aware of but which is capable of rapid ethical decision making. Physical damage to some parts of the forebrain, as happened to Phineas Gage in 1848 and to others since, will destroy all moral inhibitions we have. The latter fact is proof that it is a properly functioning brain, not some spiritual essence that is responsible for moral behavior. Further proof comes from the observation that autists lack emotions, including any sort of moral sense as a result of their brain defects. All this of course is knowledge Lewis could not have had but which Collins should have been aware of. Atheism is quickly dismissed by Lewis as being ""too simple"" (which says nothing about its validity). And his treatment of evolution is equally cavalier: ""By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us."" This materialist view is not for him for he prefers the religious view -- the view that behind the universe is something like a mind which is conscious and has purposes. And one of its purposes is to produce creatures like itself that have minds, which means us. He does not tell us how he came to know all this or why we should take his word for it and simply says that trying to disprove it by ""science in the ordinary sense"" (whatever that may mean) is impossible. Further reading reveals that not only is his science out of date but that he also makes a joke of it: ""Every scientific statement...in the long run really means something like, "" I pointed the telescope at such and such part of the sky at 2:20 A.M. on January 15th and saw so-and-so,"" or, ""I put some of this stuff in a pot and heated it to such-and-such a temperature and it did so-and-so."" My mind simply boggles at the legions of faithful who lap up this nonsense and give him five stars.

Lewis wrote some great children's books, but his non-fiction works -- the ones where he takes his mythology seriously -- leave a lot to be desired. Lewis is said to be one of the great thinkers in recent times, but I found his arguments in favor of Christianity less than compelling and rather easy to refute. At the beginning of this book, he makes a case for the existence of God, based on psychology rather than pure reason. We all ""just know"" right from wrong, he argues. We all feel that tug of conscience, he says. Well, no, we do not all feel that. There are plenty of sociopaths out there who have no empathy or sense of guilt whatsoever. They may be aware of society's rules, because they are often chillingly bright people, but that is not the same as saying that they ""hear God's voice."" For full and open disclosure, I am an atheist. I bought this book because someone said that he found the arguments irrefutable. He must really want to believe... Christians who are already in a state of denial about their beliefs may enjoy this book.UPDATE:It has been a while since I reviewed this book. I am a bit surprised at how personally Christians take any criticism of it. Even when my review was several pages down, many months old and very hard to find, people were still commenting on it.I did not mean to offend people, if I have. I almost get the feeling that people feel as if I told them their children were terrible in the school play. (Which of, course, I would never do!) :) I want to be clear that my review was not a personal attack on Christians or C.S. Lewis. If I were rating Mr. Lewis, even I would give him five stars. He seemed to me to have been a kind, thoughtful gentleman who would have made a great neighbor. I also was not criticizing his writing. Lewis was an excellent writer. I read the entire Narnia series when I was younger and I enjoyed them very much. I am just not a fan of Christian apologetics. I think it is only fair to be up front about that.Amazon's ratings system has a clear response bias. Most of the hundreds of reviews of this book are by Christians who found what they wanted to hear and responded glowingly. A few reviews are from atheists who did not find the book as interesting or meaningful. In other words, that vast majority of reviews are either five stars or one star. My one star review doesn't mean that it is a worthless book. As I said before, Christians will probably like it. I was reviewing what it did FOR ME. (By the way, I tempered my original title of this review from ""I'm not impressed"" to ""Disappointed,"" which is probably more accurate. ""Mere Christianity"" is well-written for what it is. In that sense, it is impressive. But, as I said, Lewis' writing skills were never in doubt.I am amused that so many people take the time to say that they did not (or, in a few cases, did) find my review helpful while positive reviews around mine go without much comment or feedback of any kind. Perhaps they protest a bit too much.There are clearly many thoughtful Christians out there. I did not intend to imply that because they are, in my opinion, in denial about their beliefs, that they are stupid. They are not stupid. I do think, however, that many religious people are attracted to their beliefs as much, or more, for emotional reasons than for intellectual ones. This book fills those emotional needs.

As a lover of history, I found it interesting as a commentary on the life and times of the 1920s, but at times I was left confused as to what was going on and found the plot line drab overall...There are some interesting ideas included, but they are very poorly developed. Also, there are notes included in the book about how Fitzgerald was poor with geography and made a lot of errors that had to be revised later on.

There were some things I liked about the book but more things I didn't like about the book. It seemed like too much of the same thing happened, with the affairs and then the deaths.The Characters were one of the things I enjoyed about the book. That was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it. Nick Carraway, he was the narrator, the thing that I didn't like about him was he claims to be objective. Throughout the whole book he isn't objective at all he always seems to judge others. To me Jay Gatsby was my favorite character. He started out poor and left his love to go to Vietnam and then he came back and worked hard to try to get her back. He became a millionaire. He always threw the most amazing parties and he just seemed like the man. All of the other characters I didn't like that much daisy tom Myrtle, and Daisy.The things that I didn't like about the book were there was too many affairs. I understand that there are a lot of affairs that take place in the real world but I don't think you need to have that many affairs in one book. I also don't like how Nick left Jordan at the end and he just went back because things got too weird and complicated. I also don't like how Gatsby dies at the end and I thought when Myrtle died that was a little cheesy. I mean she died by Gatsby car running over her. I couldn't stand that at all. I also didn't like how Daisy didn't wait for Gatsby; I mean if they were in love you think she would wait for him.I gave the book a bad review because to me the book didn't seem to keep my interest for a long period of time.

I found it to be poorly structured and somewhat choppy. The characters are pretty well crafted for a short novel such as this, but you don't really become enthralled with any of them. When the murder occurs, you really don't care. Even when the individual is struck by the car, you kind of go &quot;Oh, wow, that's too bad,&quot; but nothing more is felt. And there are a few minor loose ends that are never resolved. I finished the book with a feeling of &quot;Is that all there is?&quot;Perhaps the big rush to get this into print was part of the reason for its shortcomings. I'm not sure. But I think it could have been vastly improved by the author had he been given the time and also the encouragement.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['Fiction']

However, I really don't see why this book has been so highly overrated. Maybe I got my hopes so high before starting to read it, or maybe it is only to Americans that this book apeals, being written in a period that historically has been important to them. Apart from that, I really fail to see all the fuss surrounding this book. None of the characters carry a unique personality, nor the interaction between them is anything special. It is not an inspirational book by any stretch of imagination, and it's really absurd to regard this novel as the second best novel ever written in the 20th century.",['F.

Scot FitzgeraldTitle: The Great GatsbyPublished: 1925Type of Book: fictionTheme: differences between social classes and conflict with loveBackground Information: The author of this novel can greatly relate to one of the main characters. Like Jay Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald was ambitious when it came to women they wanted. They both had a sense of a rich lifestyle and they just had to be successful people.Content: Nick Carraway, who is also the narrator, moves to New York during the summertime to learn about a bond business so he rents a house in West Egg. Jay Gatsby is his rich neighbor who always throws parties every Saturday night, but he does not really engage in them. All the main characters that are in a marriage either have a mistress or another significant other.Reactions: The book becomes very appealing because all the suspense builds up as you read. You would have to keep on reading to find out what really happens next. For example, there is a part in the novel where someone gets killed but the one who killed that person seems very unlikely of them. The book affected me in a few good way too. It is better to be honest in any relationship and try your best to express yourself in a decent manner. By having the ability to be mature when it comes to certain things, it helps you have a better understanding of different situations that have to be solved.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],['Fiction']

It is a story that follows the journey of a young man Nick Carraway who moves into a neighborhood in Long Island and is a neighbor to the eccentric powerful Gatsby. Nick has a cousin, Daisy Buchanan, who he goes visits and meets her husband Tom along with beautiful Jordan Baker. Every night Nick is amazed to see his neighbors' popularity and hear about his infamous parties. One night, he is surprised to find out the Gatsby has personally invited him to one of his entertaining parties. After going to Gatsby's parties many nights he was unsuccessful at meeting him until one night he sparks an interesting conversation with a young man who turns out to be Jay Gatsby. One afternoon Nick had lunch with Miss. Baker who admits to him that Gatsby is in love with his cousin Daisy. Gatsby's intension was to confess his long lost love to Daisy and win her over like he had done five years before. After Gatsby's reunites with Daisy they decide to proclaim their love to Tom, but obstacles keep them from being together.In this book there are many themes that coincide to make an interesting story that turns out to be a tragedy. Love, greed, money, ambition, jealousy, and betrayal are all human attributes that are subtly sporadic throughout the novel. Gatsby represented money and ambition and determination along with love while the woman he loved represented greed and betrayal. Gatsby did everything in his power to get his love while Daisy was undetermined to what she wanted and whom she truly loved. The love interest between Nick and Miss. Baker ends in a unsettled dispute because of betrayal and jealousy. All the characters in the Great Gatsby are tied to these rudiments in one form or the other.These elements combined gave The Great Gatsby a great ending and made reading it worth while. Although extremely slow paced in the beginning for my taste, I was intrigued by about page 100, it satisfied me by the end. It was a surprising tragic ending that made every boring page before was worth reading. Ever since I started high school I had heard about this book and it's elegant style of the 1920's, I was extremely disappointed when I started reading it because it was nothing what it was hyped up to be. I gave the reading 3 stars because half of the book was extremely boring to me but the other half was extremely well written and thought out.

Jacobsen ""I am not young enough to know ev...",0/0,4.0,1360886400,Well-written....a Lost Generation soap opera,"With the movie pending, this seemed like a good time to re-read a novel I haven't picked up in years. So long, in fact, that I can't remember my first impressions of it. So we're stuck here with my impressions from the re-read:Gatsby, you fool. You're smart enough to pull yourself out of poverty and desperation (albeit perhaps not in the most legal way, but one takes what one can get) and then waste it all on a silly girl? How are we supposed to feel any sympathy for that? My guess is that we're not.Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation, so we have to expect a lot of pointless stuff here. That's not to say it's not interesting - on the contrary, it's a regular soap opera: love affairs, cheating, lying, crime, rich people, etc and so on. He clearly disdained the idle rich and this novel showcases that. Yet as much as Gatsby, Tom and Daisy irritate (especially Daisy, as we never really get to know her at all), they also fascinate, something I believe Fitzgerald was disdainful of.The most fascinating character, in my opinion, is found in Myrtle Wilson, the poor wife of a garage-owner who longs to escape her existence. Although Fitzgerald devotes far more time to Daisy, it is Myrtle who is complex and compelling in every way. If nothing else, you should read the book just to get a glimpse of her.The book, of course, is a tragedy. Or is it? Tragic events certainly happen, but it is difficult to feel any sense of sorrow or compassion for them.With the movie coming out, I would suggest you read this one if you missed it during your primary education years. At only 160 pages or so, it's a short read and worth your time if only so you can poke fun at the inaccuracies/exaggerations in the upcoming movie and talk about what Fitzgerald himself would have thought of the production. ;)",['F.

Lennie is gigantic, like a huge gorilla, but has the mind of a kid. While Lennie, is rather short, and 'dark of face', seemingly 'sculpted precisely.' The 2 may seem to make a very unlikely, and dysfunctional pair, but in fact, they are reasonably good friends, but at times, argue a lot. Maybe at the fact of Lennie being a bit retarded, for when he was only a young kid, he got his head banged real hard on something.But either way, they cling to each other, in the ugly face of alienation and loneliness. They get work when they can, for they have a grand plan. To own a few acres of their own land. The whole package. Have their own log cabin, a vegetable field, a cage for the rabbits, for Lennies loves those rabbits, generally their own land they can roam freely upon without hesitation or reluctance or fear.But when they start working around Salinas, for the boss of the son of a guy named 'Curley' whos only bent on giving George and Lennie, especially Lennie, a hard time, their dream, now really appearing to be merely a dream, begins crumbling before their eyes. It is within their posession; their grasp of harnessing and achieving. But when it is all said and done, not even George can prevent Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things he firmly taught him to follow, nor the seductive grace of a beautiful woman--Curley's wife.This was my first John Steinbeck book that I have read and finished, and for deciding to pick the book up and read it in the first place, I am very glad for that. After finishing it, I was granted with a heightened sense of admiration and respect toward the author, and I plan to read many more of his books.

In the same number of pages some authors use to kick off a story, Of Mice and Men builds such suspense that you'll develop the hiccups with the irregular breathing you'll take up from holding your breath and then exhaling.

The latter is scrappy and sharp and with a quick wit while the other is a large dull man with the intelligence of a child and the innocence to match. They're both on the run and need new jobs, and so they turn into a farm and make friendly with the cast of characters.Since this is a short book, anymore would be a spoiler that would jeopardize the readers' incentive to pick up this fine novel. I can tell you that it's written beautifully. It is a book of Men and Mice, of dogs and rabbits, of jealous husbands and discontent wives, of old men and young fit farmhands, and then despair. I can't read the first page without hearing classical music and I stop every time to think of the warm water flowing through the river splashing against my face, the sun beating down on my head, and the feel of the grass by the river bank.

Your heart will twist with the plot and you might even feel the thermostat drop a bit when you've hit the last page.The story's fast pace might buck you occasionally. In the name of expediency Steinbeck would have characters pop in and out of each others life in a very convenient - and unrealistic - matter as though he were writing a play, which this story was to be originally. If I didn't enjoy the quick transition from one scene to the next so much, I might consider this a flaw, but considering the alternative (having characters and the readers bumble around for pages on end) I can forgive it and see it as a quirk.

They would travel from farm to farm and do work on different farms to make their living.In this book there were many things I liked and a few things I didn't like. The book was very exciting to read. It was so exciting because I was always wondering what was going to happen next and I didn't want to put the book down. I really felt like I was actually in the book. I felt this way because Steinbeck described everything so well, and I could picture every scene that happened. The main conflict interested me a lot. It interested me because there were many obstacles that Lennie and George had to face throughout the book and I just wanted to see if they could make their dream come true. I thought that the characters felt very real. They seemed real because Steinbeck gave the right amount of descriptions about each of them. The ending was very satisfying. It was a bit sad and I think it could have been better but if it ended differently the book wouldn't have been as good.The author John Steinbeck's writing style is unusual. The author's voice is a narrative style and it's written in the way the characters actually spoke. The characters talk like poor, uneducated people. The author uses vocabulary in an interesting way. He uses poor grammar and slang words to speak like the characters. The author uses a lot of dialog in this book. The two main characters speak to each other a lot. I think that the author is a very good writer because I could actually hear the voice of the characters. He describes things but he doesn't go overboard to make it boring.Compared to other books that I have read I would rate this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because it was a very good book and held my attention but there were a few parts he could have changed, like the ending. I recommend this book to any guy or girl. It is a very fast and good read.Overall this was one of the best books I have ever read. I would put this book in my top twenty favorite books.

He describes things but he doesn't go overboard to make it boring.Compared to other books that I have read I would rate this book an eight out of ten. I give it this rating because it was a very good book and held my attention but there were a few parts he could have changed, like the ending. I recommend this book to any guy or girl. It is a very fast and good read.Overall this was one of the best books I have ever read. I would put this book in my top twenty favorite books. I've read another book by Steinbeck called The Pearl that I didn't really enjoy. I hope other books by Steinbeck are this god. Some other things that happened in this book was that Lennie wasn't very educated and George would always have to look out for him. Lennie loved to pet soft things. He would catch a mouse put it in his pocket and pet the mouse and squeeze it so hard that the mouse accidentally died. This would upset George a lot.",,

B000HTC7YG,Of Mice and Men,,,,0/0,4.0,1141084800,Of Mice and Men,"Has it been a while since you've read a book that you'll always remember? The book Of Mice and Men is just that, one you'll never forget! It's about two men named Lenny and George. They travel from work farm to work farm trying to get work. When they end up at a work farm, and things seem great, they even make plans for the future with another man they met at the work farm. An accident happens that will change their plans, and even the way they thought they felt about each other.Lenny is a fairly large man, and isn't the smartest person alive. Although he has a very kind heart, he accidentally tends to kill mice. Lenny, always does what he is told, or at least when he remembers what he is told. Lenny doesn't have the best memory either. Even with Lenny's small faults, he's a very believable character. However, George isn't as believable. George is a lot smaller than Lenny, but very smart. He takes care of Lenny and himself, trying to keep both of them out of danger. That still doesn't change the fact that George would tell Lenny to do dangerous things, so he could look smart. Also, George doesn't think Lenny is responsible and would never give Lenny the money that he earned working on the farms.I absolutely recommend this historical fiction book. Once you read the first two chapters, you're hooked on the book! I think what made me enjoy the book so much was the very ending, how much of a twist it had, and how it made the reader feel. On a scale of one to ten, I'd rate this book a nine. This book is one of those books that will just leave a mark. Books don't get any better than that!",,

A short yet powerful read with a surprise ending, ""Of Mice and Men"" will leave you wondering.""Of Mice And Men"" tells the story of George and Lennie, an unlikely pair of two California drifters. George is small and smart; Lennie is huge and, despite his size, no smarter than a young child. Tied together by a bond of hope and family, they share a single dream: to someday own their own acre of land, making a living for themselves and leaving the hired-hand life behind.Yet Lennie's inability to make the best decisions without George's help can lead to losing jobs and losing their dream. After fleeing from one of Lennie's ""bad things"", the two men find themselves on a ranch in the Salinas Valley. If they can just keep the jobs and George can keep Lennie out of trouble, they might just be able to fulfill their dream. But a too-friendly woman and a man itching for a fight stand in their way.True to his reputation, Steinbeck has created a classic book. But in some areas, ""Of Mice and Men"" disappoints. Yes, it does have those little twists of verse-like words and descriptions that make Steinbeck's work sparkle. (Notable quote: ""As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment..."")But the ending will completely throw you off. It's totally unexpected, and the tension leading up to it is a little shallow. Overall, I felt that the book didn't go quite deep enough for it to be really, truly stunning.Due to the character choice and setting, I found it hard to connect to real life. I couldn't really get that in-the-book feeling that you can find in books where you really connect with the main characters. For me, that really lessened the amount I liked this book.This book is best for older readers; kids in middle school may not be able to connect with it; find it boring; or not appreciate Steinbeck's powerful storytelling style.If you're looking for a book full of action and suspense, this isn't the one for you. Likewise, if you want an easier read that ties things up at the ending, you'd be better off elsewhere, despite this book's short page length.

As far as the plot goes, he leaves room for your imagination to fill in the blanks and gives the plot life through drama and issues that any worker would face during the early 1900s. Of mice and men, it is a must-read for any reading level.The setting is based in the early 1900s, where Lennie and George, the two main characters, work for a new employer on a swamp. The author creates great detail not only through words, but also through the actions of other characters. For example, the author never once mentions Lennie's mental disability. Instead, he uses actions and dialogue to show that he is. John Steinbeck is a magnificent author, and he has my regards.",,

B000HTC7YG,Of Mice and Men,,,,0/0,5.0,1206576000,Create Your Own Review,"Luke T. review of Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, March 17, 2008. This is a story about two completely different men who are as close as brothers. George is a small, wiry man who travels around from state to state working on different ranches, earning up some money. Once the work is done at one ranch, he moves onto another. Most of this story takes place on a ranch just a few miles south of Soledad, California. Lennie is the mentally challenged gentle giant who George looks after. George is a caring man, and promised Lennie's Aunt Clara that he would look after Lennie; so Lennie tags along with George and works very hard. While the two are working at this ranch near Soledad, disaster strikes. One day, Lennie was sitting in the barn playing with a new puppy he got, when the boss's son's wife came into the barn and started talking to Lennie. Lennie was in love with soft things, and when this girl mentioned how soft her hair was Lennie wanted to grab it, and he did. This sent the girl into a panic, and when she jerked away she broke her neck. Lennie got scared and ran away, but the girl's husband went after him. Lennie was killed because of his mistake. This book has a tragic ending, but it is a great story that shows how important friendship really is.",,

It is most obviously an attempt at satire of communism. The thing here is, does the author or any of his readers know what communism is?There are so many parallels between 1984 and Animal Farm, his other acclaimed book. Big Brother is Napoleon, of course. (parody of Stalin) Snowball is Goldstein (parody of Trotsky). The windmill is the Flying Fortress, what keeps being rebuilt over and over. There is little original about this novel.How do the numerous sexually abundant scenes in this book help its role as a satire? All that happens is Winston has sex with Julia. There is a constant war with a country, and the hint is that Oceania is THE only country in the world. Does this hint that communism creates a warlike society?Communism in its true form is a state no government has yet achieved. It occurs when the level fo technology becomes so great that machines do all the dirty work (i.e. growing crops, making clothes) and humanity can devote itself to higher, sophisticated pursuits, like drama or science. It is originally a state of peace, not war. There is no money in a society. There is no government, because everyone can do what they want to do. So bleak compared to Orwell's paranoia. Communism is too often regarded as the &quot;bad thing.&quot; Nobody really understands it. Did Orwell? The fact that he was once a member of the Communist Party makes no difference.

Had this been written at a different time, it would have been hailed differently. The fact remains, however, that this was the Cold War and everyone hated Communism. Thus anything that was against it, no matter how false or trivial, was inflated beyond belief. This wasn't limited to 1984; it was present in the case of Solzhenitsyn. Solzhenitsyn wrote a well-written anti-Soviet novel, therefore Solzhenitsyn was hailed as a hero of democracy, even though his subsequent books were mediocre. I do not believe that 1984 is a travesty because it lacks action. I believe that this book is a travesty because it is false.People say that this novel had an exquisitely crafted plot which readers such as myself are too daft to comprehend. They may be right. However, Orwell did not craft this exquisite plot. It was gleaned from Zamyatin's _We_, for starters. Secondly, this was the topic of the day. _Everyone_ was writing about how bad and evil communism was. _Everyone_ was taking pain to diffuse the utopian philosophies of the previous century. The societies of 1984 and Brave New World are very similar. 1984 and Animal Farm are the same book with the names changed. As I stated originally, the characters of the two novels are identical. Napoleon is Big Brother, or perhaps O'Brien, Boxer is Winston, Snowball is Goldstein, Squealer is Mr. Charrington, etc. Orwell plagiarized himself, Zamyatin, and countless other authors who wrote about the exact same thing.Orwell was not meaning to denegrate the theory of communism, becuase he was not familiar with the theory of communism. He was meaning to denegrate Russia and socialism and show them exactly the way the West portrayed them. It makes no difference that he was at some point a member of the Communist Party. If you read Richard Wright's _Black Boy_, you will see several Americans who were in the American Communist Party, yet didn't know the ideals they claimed to represent. They were in it for the fun. Ditto George Orwell.People say that Orwell had to understand a theory that was developed in his own country. I say: pfft. Firstly, many middle-class Americans today believe that excerpts from the Declaration of Independence are Communist propaganda meant to subvert American minds in the Cold War. (You know, the parts that say &quot;all men are created equal&quot;?) Secondly, communism was not developed in England and Karl Marx did not have sole rights to it. The ideas behind it were conceived in the epoch of Enlightenment by French philosophers.I do not say Orwell is retaliating against anything. That implies he had something against it. I believe he was simply playing upon the mood of the day to please the public. Say what they want to hear and add some sex in there to make it interesting and it will sell. People view him as God's prophet; I view him as a boring, unoriginal one-hit wonder who wanted to make a buck rehashing much-talked-of, much-written-of themes.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

Napoleon is Big Brother, or perhaps O'Brien, Boxer is Winston, Snowball is Goldstein, Squealer is Mr. Charrington, etc. Orwell plagiarized himself, Zamyatin, and countless other authors who wrote about the exact same thing.Orwell was not meaning to denegrate the theory of communism, becuase he was not familiar with the theory of communism. He was meaning to denegrate Russia and socialism and show them exactly the way the West portrayed them. It makes no difference that he was at some point a member of the Communist Party. If you read Richard Wright's _Black Boy_, you will see several Americans who were in the American Communist Party, yet didn't know the ideals they claimed to represent. They were in it for the fun. Ditto George Orwell.People say that Orwell had to understand a theory that was developed in his own country. I say: pfft. Firstly, many middle-class Americans today believe that excerpts from the Declaration of Independence are Communist propaganda meant to subvert American minds in the Cold War. (You know, the parts that say &quot;all men are created equal&quot;?) Secondly, communism was not developed in England and Karl Marx did not have sole rights to it. The ideas behind it were conceived in the epoch of Enlightenment by French philosophers.I do not say Orwell is retaliating against anything. That implies he had something against it. I believe he was simply playing upon the mood of the day to please the public. Say what they want to hear and add some sex in there to make it interesting and it will sell. People view him as God's prophet; I view him as a boring, unoriginal one-hit wonder who wanted to make a buck rehashing much-talked-of, much-written-of themes.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

B000HVR6KY,1984,,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,bixodoido,0/0,5.0,1052870400,Not to be taken lightly,"Like his earlier novel `Animal Farm,' George Orwell's masterpiece 1984 explores the terror of totalitarianism. Both novels are cases of socialism gone awry, of revolutions which start out trying to throw off an oppressive government and end up establishing a new one which is even more oppressive than before. The masses (not very intelligent, according to Orwell, and easily manipulated and persuaded) are used by the middle-class to displace the upper-class, not so a system of equality can be established (though that is the promise given to the masses) but rather that a new upper-class can take the place of an old one. It is significant that Orwell, who was a believer in socialism himself, used socialism as the basis of the revolution, but it is also true that this concept can be applied to any form of government.This book expands upon Orwell's message in `Animal Farm.' In that book, the animals stage a revolution--in this book, the revolution is already accomplished, and the new government firmly in place. The government of `Big Brother' (the dictator figure of 1984) allows its subjects no liberties and no freedoms whatsoever--not even privacy in their own homes. The past-in the form of old media and history books-is controlled by `The Party,' as is the language (The Party is working on a system of language, which will eliminate any words which do not agree with the Party's intentions). The Party government of 1984 seems very exotic, since nothing of that sort has actually taken place. But there are still lessons to be learned.Perhaps the most poignant lesson of the novel is described by the `Newspeak' word ""Doublethink"" (Orwell coined this word). It means, in effect, the ability to believe something even in the face of evidence to the contrary. A parent who will not believe her child would use drugs even when she finds them in his room is a good example of this. In fact, ""Doublethink"" is a much greater threat than we choose to believe. The genius of this novel is that Orwell is able to point out problems such as these, problems in our own society. Though most of the setting of the novel is extreme, many of the ideals and guidelines the Party teaches are real threats, threats we face today.This is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is almost standard reading for high-schoolers, but this does not mean that it is a juvenile work of fiction. On the contrary, the mental dictatorship of 1984 is not an impossible threat, even today, and for this message the book is justly termed a classic.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

Some were sad. A few were humorous, such as when they were talking about the newspeak for the first time and how they wanted to get rid of a lot of words, which would no doubt make the language quite confusing. Much of the book was creepy, though, and I found myself comparing certain things in this book to stuff that was happening currently in the United States. While an exact replica of Oceania probably isn't likely to occur, it is very possibly, and unfortunately very likely as well, that the US may at some point in the near or distant future become something very close to what Oceania was in 1984, and that's what is so scary about it. I am not saying that it is a premonition set in stone, of course, but 1984 does serve as a warning that, yes, something like this could indeed happen and will happen if we allow it to; if only more people would listen to it...The character of Winston Smith was very well portrayed. He is a confused character throughout the beginning of the book, not sure where he stands, not sure if he is insane or not, though as it goes on, he becomes more sure in his stance against Big Brother, and his struggle to remain human in an inhumane society devoid of all emotion, save for a fierce loyalty and devotion to Big Brother.There isn't a lot of action and suspense in this book, so if you're looking for that, you might do well to look elsewhere.On the other hand, there are a lot of interesting philosophies and politics discussed throughout the book, and its definitely something that will make you think long after you are done reading.

B000HVR6KY,1984,,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,Henry Platte,2/21,2.0,1081814400,It has to go,"I can understand that maybe in the wake of Nazism and under the continuation of Stalinism, the message of this book might have seemed more relevant than it in fact is. Looking past that overplayed message, though, it's difficult to detect the kind of substance, complexity of theme and depth of character which ought to make a classic. The writing is decent, but it's time to stop touting it as something everyone should read. There's no need whatsoever to read it; get the three-sentence summary from someone who has: ""This novel is about a totalitarian state. The abstract totalitarian authority figure is called 'big brother.' Totalitarianism is bad."" But it's not as though that message needs to get spread around these days.As a seperate criticism, never minding that the message it obvious, it has quite a few weaknesses. Presenting the top five reasons why the scenario in this book would never, ever come about:5) This is the English we're talking about, and they don't put up with much. I mean, they're too cool for a constitution; they've got by so far on _common law_. They've had totalitarian rulers, and when they got to be too much of a load to bear, they were beheaded.4) If children were responsible for detecting unpariotic leanings in their parents, given the usual state of parent-child relations, the secret police would recieve upwards of six thousand false reports a day, and the department would collapse.3) Aesthetics. People would complain of sexism and demand a 'big sister.' As ideals of beauty changed and people decided that Big Brother's omnipresent facade was unnatractive (too fat, maybe) they would lose all respect for him.2) Corruption.

B000HVR6KY,1984,,A16KRCLLTHSB5F,Henry Platte,2/21,2.0,1081814400,It has to go,"I can understand that maybe in the wake of Nazism and under the continuation of Stalinism, the message of this book might have seemed more relevant than it in fact is. Looking past that overplayed message, though, it's difficult to detect the kind of substance, complexity of theme and depth of character which ought to make a classic. The writing is decent, but it's time to stop touting it as something everyone should read. There's no need whatsoever to read it; get the three-sentence summary from someone who has: ""This novel is about a totalitarian state. The abstract totalitarian authority figure is called 'big brother.' Totalitarianism is bad."" But it's not as though that message needs to get spread around these days.As a seperate criticism, never minding that the message it obvious, it has quite a few weaknesses. Presenting the top five reasons why the scenario in this book would never, ever come about:5) This is the English we're talking about, and they don't put up with much. I mean, they're too cool for a constitution; they've got by so far on _common law_. They've had totalitarian rulers, and when they got to be too much of a load to bear, they were beheaded.4) If children were responsible for detecting unpariotic leanings in their parents, given the usual state of parent-child relations, the secret police would recieve upwards of six thousand false reports a day, and the department would collapse.3) Aesthetics. People would complain of sexism and demand a 'big sister.' As ideals of beauty changed and people decided that Big Brother's omnipresent facade was unnatractive (too fat, maybe) they would lose all respect for him.2) Corruption.

I first read it when selecting a book for a high school English class project, and have re-read it every few years ever since. George Orwell's 1949 novel never fails to move me, scare me, worry me, or draw me in. This reading, I listened to it on audiobook for the first time, an experience I highly recommend.As most know, 1984 is a dystopian novel - the English language dystopian novel to many (one of these days, I've got to read Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, which preceded 1984). Set in the oppressive future of 1984 in London, the major city of Airstrip One (formerly England), the novel chronicles the efforts of everyman Winston Smith to defy the omnipotent ruling Party of Oceania, the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism), and - most especially - the ever-present, omniscient gaze of Big Brother, the symbol and embodiment of the system itself.Smith begins to rebel in various ways, in particular with his lover Julia. Merely loving anyone but Big Brother is itself a crime. Winston and Julia carry on their relationship, both out of feelings for each other and to break the rules they despise. Eventually, of course, they are arrested by the Thought Police, since - after all - Big Brother Is Watching. Taken to the Ministry of Love for re-education, Winston learns what the Party is really after.Many of the elements of the novel have become concerns for modern times, especially with technological innovations that have made Orwell's science fiction science reality. Surveillance, censorship, perpetual war, manufactured patriotism, control of the language, exploitation of the middle classes. Orwell drew much of his inspiration from the Soviet Union, but it's easy to find examples of all these concerns in the front page of your local newspaper on a daily basis.As much as the technology is terrifying, the truly disturbing part of 1984 is in the mind of our hero, Winston. His struggle to remain himself while being both figuratively and literally, mentally and physically, beaten down by the apparatus of the party is gut-wrenching, as is the final result of the struggle. The last line of the book is one of - perhaps the most - powerful I've ever read.As I stated above, this was the first time I've listened to 1984 as an audiobook. I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production, narrated by Simon Prebble. Prebble is a favorite of mine, and he's at his best here. There's a certain gravity to Prebble's voice that invests his work with a power that, while enjoyable in other books, is vital here to reflect the spirit of the novel. Winston's struggles, hopes, sufferings, all are brought to vivid, grim life by Prebble's strong narration. I highly recommend Prebble's reading to anyone looking to listen to 1984. The production runs approximately 11.5 hours.1984 is a classic. I cannot recommend Orwell's masterpiece enough. Though 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's powerful warning remains timeless.",['George Orwell'],['Fiction']

The narrative reads as if the main character is talking, just pouring out his anguish, in hopes that, if someone would listen, all would be better. Domenick's fear and cynicism emanate from the book's pages. As the pace of the narrative quickens, the fear and helplessness experienced by Domenick and Thomas seem to grow. There is also the sense of Domenick's rage as his mother lays dying, his twin brother continues to be his lifetime reponsibility and source of embarassment, and two important women in his life leave his expectation of a perfect married life unfulfilled.Lamb's writing is terrific. The character of Thomas' psychiatrist Dr. Patel, who very professionally and warmly interviews Domenick, is especially well drawn. She so touchingly reaches into the soul of Domenick way past his macho bravado to unlock a very tender part of the male psyche.

Definitely not &quot;a masterpiece&quot;,"I read this book a week ago and, while I enjoyed the general premise of the story, was quite disappointed. Simply put, there was just too much going on. Lamb could have easily left half the pages out and still come to the same conclusion. Toward the middle of the book I started to become very frustrated with the repetitiveness of the situations (i.e. Dominick going to one doctor: &quot;I want my brother out of Hatch!&quot;; Dominick going to another Doctor: &quot;I want my brother out of Hatch!&quot;, on and on ad infinitum). I found the ending more than a tad bit forced, at least on the &quot;new family, sudden wealth&quot; level (I could believe the Dessa part). And what about that character, Joy... now was THAT really necessary (the Thad situation, I mean)? I lost count of the times Dominick made a point of telling the reader that things were &quot;okay&quot; with Joy, but &quot;not great&quot;... it seemed as though just about every chapter for the first half of the book contained some sort of reference to the fact that they lived together, as well as a state of the union update (all told as though the reader was previously unaware of this particular situation). The main disappointment, however, was the grandfather's story. This was nothing more than mere filler and had next to nothing to do with anything else happening in the book. Granted it related to the characters in the sense that yes, he was a relative, but other than that it really had nothing to do with Thomas' condition, Dominick's failed marriage/relationship with Joy, Dominick's anger or his mother's partiality. It was just a story about a rotten man making penance and really had no place in the story at hand. I'm giving this book three stars rather than two because of the fact that Thomas was beautifully written... his paranoia was believable, his dialogue sharp. It's as though the reader is actually listening to him speak, can picture the expression on his face.One more thing... what, exactly, is Lamb's obsession with MONKEYS all about?????????? Dominick is a &quot;little monkey&quot;; Dominico kills his brother's monkey; the little girl in the dance class wears a leotard printed with monkeys, etc. Not to mention Dominick's monkey dreams. ENOUGH WITH THE MONKEYS ALREADY!!!!! I majored in English/literature and even that didn't help me figure that one out.

The book is told by Holden Caulfield and the days before his Christmas vacation break. He is a troubled boy with depression problems that will be visible encounter as the book is told by him. The part I thought was interesting is how a person can exclude themselves from the world and become depressed. Holden attended Pencey Prep, and all boys' school. This would be the fourth school he attended and got kicked out of or chose to leave. I believe if he is already on the fourth school, something must be wrong. I feel bad that this keeps happening to him, but it is also his fault for allowing it to happen. Holden is now being kicked out of Pencey Prep, he didn't apply himself so his grades where really poor and they asked him to leave the prep school. The major problem that he has with this world is that he thinks that everyone is phoniness. I think he is also phony because there is a guy Ackley who he can't stand but he still talks to and is kind of nice to. Holden decides to leave early from Pencey before Christmas break starts. He and his room mate got in a big fight over a girl. Holden gathers all of his belonging and catches a train to New York City where his family lives. He doesn't go home to his families' apartment. He decides to spend two days consuming alcohol and loneliness in New York. I think he should have gone home to get help from his family other then getting drunk and not solving any of his real problems. His problems were still there when he became sober the next morning. Also if he went home he wouldn't be lonely because he would have his little sister and his parents there with him. He decides once his money is gone, nothing can get any worst so he goes back home to his parent's apartment and visit his sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only person he is able to communicate with in the entire book. After talking to Phoebe he feels better and decides to see an older teacher of his before his parents get home. He visits with Mr. Antolini thinking that it would make him better but really he leaves his house feeling more depressed. He doesn't understand how hid world is so full of phoniness and thinks it is such a horrible place to grow up in. I feel bad for him because he needs help, his world can be bad but with his problem it is making it so much worst and harder for him to live in. He all the sudden decides that he is going to move West. The first person he thinks about telling first is Phoebe, he meets her in the park and watchers her with fright as she plays. Holden decides that there can be no catcher, that all you can do is hope kids develop in this harsh world on their own. Holden is now being hospitalized and recovering from his illness that had taken over him. I hope he comes out seeing the world differently and isn't as lonely, and is able to make a direction for himself. I thoroughly liked this book. It wasn't a happy cheerful book but you got to see inside someone with an illness of this kind. There are so many people suffering with this disease and it is so hard to understand how this could happen to a person but it occurs everyday.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']
B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,A2DNP0WL4K9SP,Stephanie,0/0,4.0,1074124800,Catcher in the Rye review,"If you are a person who appreciates honesty, I believe Catcher in the Rye will appeal to you. This book is one of the most honest and true books I have ever read. Holden, the main character in the book, gives his thoughts about people and everyday life. Just reading about the reality of these thoughts kept me wanting to read more the whole time. You get caught up in his opinions and views and forget that he is only a sixteen-year old boy. It was refreshing to read something and to feel like it wasn't sugar coated or only part of the truth.The book as a whole did not show an overwhelming amount of love or compassion, but there is one certain area when it did. Holden admits to not liking many people. However, the person to whom he cares most about, in my opinion, is his younger sister, Phoebe. When he shows his feelings for her, it makes the effect greater because he does not do this for anyone else. It provides an escape from all of the negativity and therefore makes you appreciate it even more so. He treats Phoebe with great love and respect, in spite of the fact that she is only a child. This warms you and lets you even more into the heart of Holden.If you look deeper into the novel, you will notice that it is about loneliness as well as the need of others. Holden's loneliness strikes out at you as throughout the book he continues on his search for a girl. He mentions at several times that he does not like being with a girl names Sally, yet he creates this extravagant idea of them sneaking off and getting married together. This shows how lonely he actually is. I believe it is easy to relate to him because he shows how he is scared of change, and in some ways, relationships. I liked that aspect of the book.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading more about thought and feelings over a significant plot.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,ASUTHQGBKP0JP,...play me like a radio...,0/0,5.0,1074124800,Caught 5 stars.,"I recently read the book The Catcher in the Rye for English class. When I first started the book I thought it was going to be another boring classic. But I was wrong. I completely loved the book.Holden Caufield is the main character and narrator of the novel. He is very cynical which I found amusing. He tells this wild story about 3 days of his life before Christmas break. As I was reading the book it seemed like a lot more than 3 days.I think Salinger did an excellent job writing this book. He wrote this book and it wasn't really based on anything. It didn't have some huge plot structure or anything fancy. The book just had extremely well developed thoughts and characters. I simply couldn't just put the book down I read almost the whole thing at once. What made me stop was the fact that it was 3 AM!On some levels I could relate to Holden's despair at being in a world full of weirdo's and wackos. And also highly dislike or hate most of the people around you. But you have to put up with them because they are the only ones around. The Catcher in the Rye is a good vehicle to demonstrate how society was taking a turn for the worse. Like in the one part he keeps talking about how sick it is how he keeps seeing ""F@%$ You"" written all over the wall.Salinger uses a lot of popular slang consistent with the setting of the story, which made reading tedious at times because I didn't understand half of it. But other than that this is definitely a book to read!",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

Holden the 17 year old narrator of the novel is just plain &quot;phony&quot;. I say this because all throughout the novel he is telling us about how he thinks everything and everyone is phony. He narrarated the novel in first person from a psychiatric facility months after the events in the novel occurred. His reactions to people are weird. At first I found them an annoyance but once I kept reading the novel his reactions became kind of humorous. The whole novel took place just about two days before his Christmas break. His sister Phoebe acts as his best friend and he tells her everything. Holden always seems to mess up his chances with the girls he goes out with and always makes dumb mistakes.He never really thinks over what he does. One person who tries to help Holden out is Mr. Spencer who is a history teacher at his school Pencey Prep. Holden didn't want to listen to Mr. Spencer though because Holden thinks he did nothing wrong. Mr. Antolini was Holden's favorite teacher and when Holden went to visit him, he makes Holden feel uncomfortable. It seems that every time he tries to connect with someone there becomes a conflict. Nothing ever seems to go smoothly for him.The meaning of the title &quot;Catcher and the Rye&quot; is a person who tries to catch little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff and this is what Holden's goal is in life. I think you can decide for yourself but in the end I think you will agree with me. Holden is a very odd character and you must have patients to read this novel.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,A1FK8O3NQTIAP3,Brian Provenzano,0/0,4.0,1074470400,A Must Read,"Catcher in the Rye is about a troubled teen by the name of Holden Caulfield. At the beginning of the book, Holden is thrown out of his highly prestigious prep school. In fact, this the 4th school that he has been expelled from. Holden is very connected to his sister and sympathizes about his dead brother a lot in the book. I am also very connected to my sibling just like him. Throughout the book Holden refers to people as being &quot;phony&quot;. I can relate to this greatly because nothing bothers me more than people expressing themselves differently than their true selves. Holden's struggles during the book were interesting to follow because at times they would remind me of my past. I specifically liked the ending because the author does not leave a definite ending. He allows the reader to create and ending in their own mind that would fit the way that they perceived the book.J.D. Salinger does a magnificent job of creating a character that can relate to so many young people. He takes the reader on a 48 hour journey of Holden's life, and it makes you never want to never put the book down. I would suggest all teenagers to read this book. In fact, I would strongly recommend this book to be a must read in high school's across the country due to its extraordinary portrayal of a troubled teen in society.

I have to admit, it hooked me right at the beginning. I didn't read this book for school though, so I wasn't forced to analyze it, but I almost wished we did. I'd been expecting Holden to commit suicide at the very end, but his life turned out the way he feared it would be. I think that's worst than being dead. Sometimes, it made me laugh whenever he hit u with another of his endless wry comments. But sometimes, it makes me wonder, if it really is like the way Holden think it is. I mean, he views everyone as if they have an evil agenda lurking behind their masks. He almost convinced me that everybody are like that. It also made me think twice on how I perceived kids like Holden who get kicked-out from school. For me, they're just another bunch of losers who doesn't care for their future or their parents' money. But Holden, he is different. I mean wat kind of loser who worries about his little sister and her classmates seeing the ""F***-You"" vandalism on the walls and who gets depressed when he only gave 10 bucks to those nuns. And then there's the Mr. Antolini guy. I thought he was one of those person who Holden can trust and all, and then he turned out to be a pervert. Im not even gonna share Holden's doubts, but I was almost sure that he can't trust anybody anymore except for his sister and his dead brother, Allie. Im still not done thinking about this book. and that's probably why I gave it a five-star rating. It's one of those books that leaves u baffled. Most books makes things clearer to u. This book, well, let's just say, it cleared some things to me in a weird kind of way. I'm not dumb or anything, and I admit I dont understand a lot of things about Holden, but I'm pretty sure it's not a happy ending for Holden. I know how Holden feels when he told Phoebe that all he wanted to do in his life is to be this catcher of little kids on a rye field. It really is a simple dream, yet it doesn't exist. He has to go through all the garbage in the world, before he can find one good thing. It's sad when that one last good thing turned out rotten.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

It's on the Cereal Killers release.&quot;They called me William Holden Caulfield; it was no compliment. What's wrong with William Holden Caulfield? All that stuff that bummed me out ten years ago still bums me today, and boy I wanna know - who died and made you my mom and me some stupid kid? How can we forget all those things we did?&quot;&quot;I'm afraid of people who like Catcher In The Rye. Yeah I like it too, but someone tell me why people he'd despise say I feel like that guy. I don't wanna grow up cause I don't wanna die.&quot;I'm just a few months away from turning 40. Maybe it's my midlife crisis that caused me to want to go back and reread this book for the umpteenth time. I go back and read it every few years, and it always moves me. The line from the song notwithstanding, I think alot of people relate to Holden, because alot of us are still struggling to figure out who we are - just like Holden.I've always gotten a kick out of the things that bug Holden, and how he hates them specifically, not generally. Wish I had the book in front of me, but to do that I'd have to go back into the bedroom and run the risk of waking my wife. For Holden, that would be something like &quot;It bugs me when guys are reviewing a book and won't go back into their bedrooms to get it because they are afraid of waking up their wife. I hate that.&quot; See what I mean? He says it as though it's something that has happened thousands of times over instead of something that just happened.Holden is a lovable, insecure kid who is struggling to &quot;keep it real&quot;, whatever that means. I think we all find something to relate to in his insecurity and his frustration with how the world doesn't meet with his pathological view of it. It's sad to think that high schools would have banned this book. Oh no, we can't have our students actually thinking. We just want them to feel good about themselves...It just hit me that the Replacements song &quot;Sixteen Blue&quot; fits nicely here as well. And let's not forget &quot;Roller-skate Skinny&quot; by The Old 97s. (That's how Holden described Phoebe - &quot;she's skinny.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,,,0/0,4.0,1076889600,A book i like,"There are two kinds of books in my opinion, one is the kind of book which you hope it never has an ending, but it ends quickly. The other kind of book is the one that you want it to end quickly, but it&iexcl;s so boring and looks like takes forever to finish it.The catcher in the rye is the first kind of book. It ends so quickly before you start to realize it. The author J.D. Salinger portrayed the character so well that it almost sounded like the book is written vividly through the mind of a 16-year-old teenager. The book explores character&iexcl;s mind but not really showing the motive of his actions. Therefore there is a lot of space for the reader to kind of guess of what is going on in the character&iexcl;s mind. Salinger uses little symbolism and he doesn&iexcl;t focus on imagery descriptions.The theme of this book grabs the reader in; it is dealing about how teenager always think there believes are correct and would not accept other people&iexcl;s opinion or think about challenging their own. This kind of viewpoint that is used to look at the world will create and cause the generation gap to occur.The generation gap is often used to express the contradiction and the dispute between parental expectation and teenager&iexcl;s behavior. Most of the time teenagers are facing lots of unknown and can&iexcl;t figure the way out. The harder they tried the more depress they might get. That&iexcl;s the depression which is all that mattered. You can retreat to the shell for safety or try again facing another unknown or even go to diminish yourself. It&iexcl;s not so easy for the signs of depression to ware off. Nevertheless you have to live with it and each time when one faces a different situation they have to take it in an optimistic way or either a negative way.What&iexcl;s more, J.D Salinger imitate the writing style of an immature narrator and thoroughly captured his emotions which are why I appreciate this book so much that not only it is well written but I can also relate to Holden Caulfield who are one of those teenagers who are very conservative and wanting to keep the innocence of childhood alive. Sometimes I feel the same way too from which captures me and fascinated me about how this book is written so the reader can judge the narrator with their own perspective and experience.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,A3KZ4L8IMYRPHG,Josh Jarosz,0/0,5.0,1078272000,The best book i've ever read,"""The Catcher in the Rye,"" is one of the books in my life that I had actually taken the time to read and enjoy. I first heard about the book from a friend, and he told me it was one of the most enjoyable books he had ever read. I was shocked to hear this, because my friend is one of those kids that only reads a book if he has to, and he usually doesn't enjoy anything he reads. So, I took his advice and read ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and to my surprise, I wasn't able to put the book down. The reasons I couldn't stop reading was that I enjoyed the fact that I was reading about a kid who is roughly my age who has a lot of problems and events going on in his life, just like any other teenager.Holden, who is the main character in the story, is one of the reasons why I liked the book. Holden is someone who I would say to be a semi-normal teenager. He is normal in the fact that he isn't sure about the world, and he always wants to experience what others are experiencing. He constantly feels the need to be sexually involved with a woman, and goes to such extent as to flirt and dance with women that are 3 times as old as he is. Holden's character is very entertaining, because he is so rebellious. One way he is rebellious is the fact that he has failed out of three schools, and when the story begins, he has just failed out of his fourth. He entertained me because, he is always mad about something. He likes a girl named Jane Gallagher, who he has dated in the past, but his roommate Stradlater is dating her now. This angers Holden, because Stradlater is constantly teasing Holden about what he does with Jane. Holden attempts to fight Stradlater, but Stradlater is to strong and the fight ends up with Holden getting a bloody nose, which shows Holden's cocky side.Even though Holden is going through a tough time in his life, he still has time for his sister Phoebe, who is the one person that makes him happy. Holden's love for Phoebe is another reason why I enjoyed the book. I liked the fact that being a big brother to his sister was important to him, it helped show Holden's softer side. When he got kicked out of school, his sister Phoebe was the only family member that he personally told. He never even told his parents that he was kicked out of school. That proved to me that Phoebe was very important in Holden's life, and that he was most comfortable around her.Overall, I would have to say that ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a great book. I was glued to the book the whole way through. The only aspect of the book that I didn't completely enjoy was the ending. When the book is concluded, it leaves the reader without a conclusion of Holden's story. Instead, it allows the reader to decide and predict what will happen to Holden as he journeys to his new school and how the rest of his life turns out. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a very easy book to read and will be able to keep your attention throughout the whole story.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']
B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,A3EIBBRHDAQ69C,Dave Spence,0/0,5.0,1078358400,One of the best books i've read to date,"The Catcher in the Rye is worthy of all the praise it's gotten throughout the many years it's been around. It proves to be a timeless classic to me. Many times when I try and sit down to read a book I can read it for a while but eventually slip away from it, and never finish what I started. I found this to be one of those books that kept me interested the whole time though. The one thing I would compare this book to would have to be the classic sitcom Seinfeld. The reason for this is simply because they are both very well written and regard things we all relate to in some way, but in the end when all is said and done don't have a major plot to it that really jumps out at you. Of course I do not mean this in the bad way at all. I really enjoyed this intricate and groundbreaking way the whole book is brought together. The book is narrated the whole way through by the main character, Holden Caulfield, starting as he has just recently been expelled from his last school, Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is different from most other schools. To attend the school you must stay in dorms they have like you would for college. It is also broken into semesters with a christmas break splitting up the 2 semesters. The Catcher in the Rye takes you on Holden's journey as he decides to leave Saturday night before everyone else who will be going home for Christmas break on that next Wednesday. It follows him as he travels around New York. He isn't going home yet because he is waiting for his parents to get the letter of his expulsion and giving them time to cool off. Although it is many people's belief that Holden is, as he would call himself, &quot;a madman&quot;, as I read the book I couldn't help but relate myself to him in some ways. He really is the epitome of a teenage guy in many ways, just in a way over-dramatized. It's my belief he really has a good heart. It's just sad he doesn't see anyone's actions as &quot;real&quot;. He interacts with everyone the same as most teenagers really, he just won't see past the negative in people. It's funny how he creates excuses for things just like any teen would too. For example he's &quot;never in the right mood&quot; to call Jane, a neighbor of his when he's at home, who you can tell he has a big crush on. This is really in my perspective just him doing what all of us seem to do by creating an excuse he views as a good reason not to do something that he really wants to do deep inside. I think he does this because of fear of rejection in some ways and also nervousness. The one thing he never will put down is his family. I really like the fact that no matter what other flaws you may see in him u will not see a moral decay when you look at the way he treats his family. He loves and respects all his family members and is very genuine in his feelings for them. The book basically concentrates on Holden, the main character, struggling with great depression that's overcome him. He can't get away from it. He tries to overcome it by talking with others all the time but keeps turning the people he talks with away for some flawed reason. He's trying to fit in this society but at the same time pushing himself away. We all can relate to this, especially as teens, when you want to see the reasons behind things we all are obligated to do, such as getting our education in school, but sometimes find ourselves becoming fed up with the way our system is. I hold this up as one of the best books I have read to date, and highly recommend you read this book no matter who you are.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

A few of my friends had recommended it and one in particular was obsessed and finding references to it in everything. I wanted to relate to Holden Caulfield, being sixteen and cynical.But I couldn't.Maybe it's because I'm a girl, but I'm fairly jaded in my views and I found Holden pretentious and boring. I also found him hypocritical; in his everpresent disgust towards the ""phony"" people around him, he himself became like them, a snotty rich New York brat who had nothing to complain about yet went on childish tirades about anything and everything. With everything I heard I expected this book to represent the pinnacle of unabashed teenage angst, but instead I wasted a couple of hours of my life listening to the rantings of an emotionally immature teen. No, I didn't think much of the swearing, but that wasn't a big problem in my opinion. It was the overused slang and refering to everyone as ""old ______."" It was the ludicrous events that Holden experienced that nowhere near stood the test of time. Most of all, it was the fact that I have known twelve year olds who had more rational thought processes than Holden ever had.The only thing that kept this book from receiving one star from me was a.) his sister, who was the only genuine character, b.) Holden's Romeo and Juliet tirade, because I actually agreed, and c.) The incident with the swear word in the school and museum.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,,,0/0,5.0,1088899200,Coming of age in New York,"Like Twain's &quot;HUCK FINN, Crane's RED BADGE OF COURAGE or even TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD, this coming-of-age novel is and will always remain, a classic. The novel begins with Holden, a boy in his late teens who has experienced a life with many mishaps and unjust occurrences. Pencey was the school he attended most recently, being one of many schools he had dropped out of during the past few years. He left school, ventured out on his own in the busy, chaotic city of New York. There, he met up with many acquaintances, experienced the truth in his life, and learned lessons to help improve his future. He faces the decision of what he is to do with his life, and ends up making a predictable pick. The main difference bettween either HUCK FINN or MOCKINGBIRD is that while those novels were rural, CATCHER IN THE RYE is set in New York. Still, it's amazing to see the smilarities in the two; the way all adolescents have to make decisions. There were many educational, enjoyable scenes in CATCHER IN THE RYE. One that kept me on my toes was when Holden was first beat up by his dorm mate, Stradlater. It was suspenseful, and the way he handled the situation helped reveal his personality. Another exciting part was when Holden met up with a fellow student's mother on a trolley. He told many lies to her, and ended up regretting it after he found out she was a genuine, generous woman, much unlike her own son. When the prostitute arrived at Holden's hotel room, something rotten was bound to happen. The description of this chapter kept me reading. I enjoyed reading about the way Holden described his everyday surroundings, and what he liked, disliked, which was obvious, because he was such an open character. There were many aspects that vexed me, because he was repetitive with his attitude. He seemed to despise nearly everything, all of the time. Even cheap luggage would make an impact on his judgment of a person, and he had many other prejudices along with that. At times, the writing style seemed dull and boring because he irritated the reader with meaningless remarks. Many topics that were discussed seemed quite pointless, and Holden lacked alot of common sense as a character. I would recommend this novel to readers 14 years and older. Some material is inappropriate for younger people. The book is easy to get into, and mostly keeps you interested. The main characters are complicated and easy to both adore and abhor. The book taught me a lot about life alone through the eyes of a teenager. Because of his peer pressure, he had to make many decisions that hurt him and hurt people he loved. The novel expressed bravery and a boy able to forgo his past and attempt to start a new life.Also recommended: HUCK FINN by Twain, THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE by Crane, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD",['J.D.

B000I3NFKG,THE CATCHER IN THE RYE,,,,0/0,4.0,1088899200,Edge of my seat,"J.D. Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye, is an exceptional portrayal of the problems and situations that teenagers experience in their lifetime. Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old boy, writes about his previous expulsion from Pencey Prep. He tries to cope with the death of his younger brother, his obsession for lying, and the problem relationships with his peers and teachers. Before Holden came to Pencey Prep, he lived a hard life. His father is an obsessive businessman, and his mother has yet to recover from the death of his younger brother, Allie. Holden fails in school, tends to get drunk and uses vulgar language. Throughout the rest of the novel, Holden encounters other students and teachers that just don't understand him and give him a hard time. Mr. Spenser, his history teacher tries to be sympathetic to Holden's problems, however he fails after a while because it is sometimes frustrating communicating with Holden. The headmaster asks Holden to leave the prep school as he is failing four of five classes and not applying himself. Holden returns home, borrows money from his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, and leaves for the night. After that night, Holden decides to leave home, for good, and head west. Phoebe begs to leave with him, but Holden refuses. He remains confused about returning to school. The novel ends with Holden in a mental institution.I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye because of the complex problems that Holden faces throughout the novel. Not all plotlines have to portray perfect lives of people. It is nice to have a different and unique plotline for once. It relays real-life experiences that teenagers still face today. Although this book was written 50 years ago, it remains a good lesson for children and young adults to learn today. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I read it all in about 3 hours, and I usually don't like to read books, however this book was different; I never wanted to put it down. Just remember, like Holden, be true to yourself, but don't overdo it and waste your life failing out of classes and getting drunk.

Any book/story/movie that deals with teenagers' coming-of-age angst has undoubtedly been influenced by Salinger's dual portrayl of the troubled Holden, at once insanely immature; at the other, wise beyond his years.&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; gives us a weekend in the life of its main character, a troubled sixteen-year-old who has just been thrown out of another school for failing all subjects, except English because he is a master at writing compositions. He also credits himself to be a master at lying and always finds himself spinning wonderfully impossible yarns to strangers. Holden is disaffected and somewhat emotionally withdrawn. Through his flashbacks to the past, we learn about the death of his brother Allie and his experiences at other schools. Allie's death has affected him more than even Holden realizes and he finds himself unable to connect to anything or anyone permanently. And when he finds himself kicked out of school again, he fears having to confront his parents at home so he goes on a whirlwind trip to New York City, which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and isolation.Salinger has created a prototype character with Holden Caulfield. He is witty and wise, but at the same time foolishly naive and over-sensitive. Yet his insights into the adult world and the phonie ways that people behave are bitterly correct. Holden knows at once what he doesn't want to do or be, but couldn't tell you what he wants to do. And when he realizes what that is, it truly is one of the most eloquently written pieces of dialogue in American literature.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

Houlden Caufield is a character that's sure to remain with you days after you are done reading the book. Throughout his journey home from being kicked out of school Houlden takes you on a trip around New York city visiting some of the places the city is infamous for and on the way you see him work out his frustration and rebellion. By the timeHoulden gets home he realizes that he can't run away from life anymore but rather live it as best as he can with what he is given.Salinger's use of profanity and his laid back and easy going tone appeals greatly to teenagers. While reading you are sure to forget that you are reading and as Houlden makes his way home you in turn leave feeling a little bit more accepting of your own life. I truly think teenagers will appreciate this book and will also gain from it immensely.,['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

The first time I read this book at age 12, I though it was the funniest book I'd ever read. When I read it again at age 14, I thought it was the saddest.

Salinger, you should keep in mind that it takes place in the late forties. Customs and the way people go about things were very different than they are now. Or, maybe it's just the way Holden, the main character, reacts to the events in his life.The Catcher in the Rye is about a seventeen-year-old boy, Holden, who drops out of prep school, without telling his parents. This leads to him hanging around New York City in the days preceding Christmas break. He is your typical rebelling teenage boy. He tends to use lots or crude language and enjoys rather large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Some common phrases Holden uses are: ""For Chrissake"", ""Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing?"", ""Jesus! What the hell happened to you!"", ""That depressed the hell outta me"", and ""Goddamnit!"". Although, when faced with the opportunity for a prostitute he takes it, but when she arrives, he can't bring himself to commit the act. That seems to be the only real commendable thing about Holden. The only other thing that I liked about this book was the relationship Holden had with his younger sister, Phoebe. Here is a quote that shows how Holden cares for Phoebe. ""I'm going with you. Can I? Okay? Please."" ""No. Shut up. You're not going. Now, shut up."" This is the part where Holden decides he is going to go out west and Phoebe wants to go with him, but he won't let her. This caring feeling that Holden has for Phoebe also comes through in other parts of the book.At the end, problems are solved, but not in a reasonable or logical manner.I didn't get much of anything out of this book at all. There's really no lesson learned, point or objective and not much of a happily ever after either. Personally, this book could and should have lasted much longer. The author could have spend more time really getting to the bottom of Holden's problems and telling more about how things turned out for Holden. It just seems like he got tired of writing the book and took the easy way out. The last chapter: ""That's all I'm going to tell you about. I could probably tell you about what I did after I went home, how I got sick and all, and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall, after I get out f here, but I don't feel like it. I really don't. That stuff doesn't really interest me too much right now."" This book may be considered a classic, but I don't see what makes it that way.",['J.D. Salinger'],['Fiction']

I was wowed, amazed that someone could have been thinking the same things I had been thinking in such earlier years.Now, I am not -that- much older, a little wiser (I think), but I've definitely outgrown my spat of bitterness.

Now, this particular adult admits that he has not particularly enjoyed Rowling's book, despite the considerable effort he has put into trying. I cannot and will not judge its educational value, since there have been many books I've read as a child which had very little such content (such as Roald Dahl's books; and what is the educational value of Winnie the Pooh, exactly, besides being the world's most adorable bear?).I can't find any faults with Rowling's writing, but on the other hand I can't find any virtues, either. Rowling's imagination is nothing more than the conscious and unconscious borrowing of cultural motifs and the mixing of them together, hoping that if she'll mix enough different motifs we won't be able to recognize them. I don't even think Rowling herself realized how lacking in originality her book is. Example: the three headed dog guarding the underground - Greek mythology. The chess game - Alice in Wonderland. Boy sent to cruel relatives (and then gets back at relatives) -almost all of Roald Dahl's books. I don't buy her arguement that these were done intentionally, and even if they were, borrowing without bounds from other works doesn't make your work any deeper or more meaningful. It's all form, not content.I suppose Harry Potter has its merits and little children do enjoy reading it, but adults, unless they have a special interest in children's literature, should really try out for more adult fiction - Rowling's characters are simply one dimensional and uninteresting. If you're really feeling a rush of nostalgia, why not check out more magical children's books? George Macdonald's works are just as good today as they were in the 19th century, and Roald Dahl's books are hilarious. Life is too short to waste on mediocre fiction such as this.",['J. K.

At first, they seemed enjoyable, and they definately held my interest. They are obviously children's books, and I am keeping this in mind, but there are two glaring problems with these books:1. All the characters, whether good and evil, all sneak around and cheat to accomplish their aims. There are generally no consequences, or else the consequences don't match the deceit involved. Harry Potter and his friends (the good guys) constantly sneak around, lie, and steal to do whatever it is they need to do. When caught, they manage to miss the most severe punishment or else get off scott free. There are two problems with this: First, it just gets annoying after a while to see every plot twist accomplished by a &quot;good&quot; character acting this way, especially when they are kids, and second (and more importantly), Is this the message we want to send to the millions of young kids who read these books?2. Rowling constantly employs Deus ex Machina to solve plot problems. Harry Potter is extraorinarily passive. At first, he is at the mercy of the evil Dursleys, and then of Hagrid, and then of bullies at Hogwarts, then the teachers there, then the bad guys. He is always &quot;getting into situations&quot; from which he must be extracted with strained plot twists. Someone comes along to save the day, or whatever it might be. After a while, this becomes extremely tedious to read. Harry Potter is contantly in the middle of situations he didn't create for himself. He is blamed for doing things he didn't do; he is at the wrong place at the wrong time; a teacher or fellow student hates him for no apparent reason. All of this adds up to a storyline full of holes.I gave it two stars because, in spite of all this, the books did hold my attention, and Ms. Rowling is, I think, good at writing (if not storytelling).",['J.

The outcome of the game is almost entirely in the hands of someone that has nothing to do with the bulk of the gameplay or teams, and relies on an entirely different skillset. It's still convincing in terms of pointless English boarding school sports, but not as the unofficial sport of Rowling's wizarding world.The rest of Rowling's worldbuilding is generally better, although never particularly organized or systematic; there are never any clear rules of magic. It's more a hodgepodge of various myths and tales and some inventions. None of it is startlingly original, but despite some occasionally stilted prose Rowling weaves it together remarkably well.

An amazing beginning to an amazing series.,"A short, skinny boy with untidy hair and broken glasses and a scar on his forehead. A tall, gangly red-head with various hand-me-downs from his five older brothers. A bushy-haired girl who is absolutely book-smart, but also sometimes bossy and rash. It amazes me to this day that such a hugely popular book series could star a main cast such as the one I just described. Even more amazingly, we actually care about these characters and all of their adventures.Harry Potter owes a debt to the great fantasy that came before it, but it never falls into the trap of copying everything that preceded it. Sure, there are the fairly cliched plot devices of a young boy with dead parents who goes on an incredible journey to kill the male antagonist, but others like Hagrid the half-giant, Diagon Alley, Platform 9 3/4, Quidditch, the Invisibility Cloak, and the incredibly touching Mirror of Erised all came straight from Rowling's incredible imagination. There is something marvelous in every chapter of Harry Potter.The writing in Sorcerer's Stone isn't perfect, and one could argue that it's not even good, but Rowling's sense of humor, and again, her imagination really shine through. Her writing is very accessible but never patronizing, making Harry Potter a perfect choice for young readers, not only to give them a perfect reading choice, but also to spur a possible life-long interest in reading.One thing I like about the series is that it's not a clear-cut tale about good vs. evil (this is made clear by the last few books in the series). Plenty of important themes are tackled, and all of them with grace--another argument for why young readers should read Harry Potter.All in all, there is just so much to love about the series. The first book will have you hooked; by the time you reach the third book, you will desperately want to finish up the whole series, even though you know that means about 3,000 more pages of reading.

B000IEZE3G,Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,,A5ODAL00VVTL2,Wu Wei,3/40,1.0,1247356800,Rowling corrupted her own creation,"Once upon a time, JK Rowling came up with a truly magical idea, one that deservedly made her very wealthy: children at a magical school, one which overlapped London. However, Rowling never really let us enjoy that magical world. Beginning with the first book, Rowling corrupted and destroyed her own creation. With each successive book Harry Potter's world became uglier and less magical. With each new book Rowling added more and more political preaching about the real world.So this is a review of the entire series and I am about to give the ultimate spoiler. The forces of good are utterly defeated in the Potter series. The real villain is JK Rowling, not Voldemort. By the time the series completes there is no joy anywhere in the magical world, and there are no heroes. All the characters are dead or tainted by evil. Banality, conflict, anarchy, corruption, and violence run unchecked throughout the magical world.Everyone wants to read about students at Hogwarts. How does Rowling cheat us out of that?#1 - ALL AUTHORITY FIGURES ARE BADAny school story must include students being taught by teachers. Rowling refuses to allow that to happen, because of her attitude towards authority figures. Every teacher and authority figure in Potter's world is either incompetent, corrupt, evil, or for some reason unable to help the students. The authority figures also neglect the children and fail to protect them. Books, Hermione, and Harry end up being the real teachers and leaders.#2 - RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKENNeither the children nor the faculty respect the rules of the school. Punishments are arbitrary and rule-breaking is even rewarded. The rules are often bizarre. Most characters seem to view the rules as meaningless pedantry, a formality which all must waste time pretending to comply with.This makes Hogwarts seems less like a school than a hotel where Harry meets his magical peers.#3 - ABUSE, VIOLENCE, TORTUREThe books are loaded with abuse, violence, and torture, including cruelty to animals and children. No one in the books seems to care. Characters like Harry Potter respond with their own cruelty and no one cares. The abuse begins in the first book and steadily worsens throughout the series.#4 - THERE ARE NO HEROESRowling goes beyond corruption of authority figures. Her rule is that there can be no good people at all, no heroes. Everyone must be cut down and leveled.No one in the Potter books seems to have a moral code. Harry loves to lie, read other people's correspondence, argue with his friends, etc. Concepts like self-sacrifice surface from time to time, but there is no follow through.The end result of all this is a grim world in which there is mechanical magic, but nothing truly good. There is no idealism in Harry Potter's world. There is no duty, no honor, no family, no self-sacrifice, no wise teachers, and no experts.In Harry's world there is only SELF.",['J. K.

I love fantasy, and it's about the only genre I read these days, but Tolkien does absolutely nothing for me.The story was extremely childish (which, I suppose, makes sense, since it was written as a children&#65533;s story). Bilbo and company would get themselves in trouble, and the solutions and the ways they got out of seemingly overwhelming circumstances were&#65533; laughable at best. Trolls get turned to stone by the coming of dawn, giant spiders easily abandon their prey at the sound of a taunt, and even the dragon proves to be less than fierce. Very silly indeed. The writing style was incredibly repetitive! If I had to read, one more time that &#65533;Bilbo wished he was back in his hobbit hole&#65533; and not for the last time!&#65533; I would have had it. As it was, the repetition was really trying my patience. Also, the first person narrator bothered me. Who WAS this person? If he constantly refers to himself as &#65533;I&#65533;, then he should make it clear who he is, and how he knows all about the hobbit&#65533;s adventures!

It is the most abyssmal plodding reading possible! I can't imagine the audience for whom the book was written-is it children? ... because it is terribly juvenile and silly [but definitely not in an enjoyable way-mostly annoying and idiosyncratic]...but if the target audience IS children, the stylized writing and archaic use of English completely upsets that purpose!

You almost get the feeling that there really is a 'Middle Earth' out there somewhere.The saying ""out of the frying-pan and into the fire"" comes to mind when I describe The Hobbit to you, because this is a very fast-paced story, though not in the sense that the book is made of one epic battle scene after another. The plot spans over about a year, but the journeying itself is described sparingly while their (often dangerous) encounters with monsters and other races are described in great detail. The downside to this was that the climax seemed a bit rushed,but I enjoyed it nonetheless.The narration is old-fashioned, yet perfectly understandable. It reminded me of my middle grade teacher who used to read out loud to us in class. Sometimes the narrator speaks directly to the reader by commenting on the current happening in the book and it made me feel as if the narrator was letting me in on a secret of his by sharing the story to me.I really liked that Bilbo was, ironically, a very unenthusiastic participant in his own adventure. Though his almost dormant Took family genes, who are known for their odd adventurousness, is what in the end makes Bilbo accept his job as ""The Burglar, "" I'd dare say he is pretty much dragged into the whole thing. Tolkien uses a simple but effective way to show the great character development that Bilbo makes throughout the story by comparing the two sides of his heritage to each other. When he starts out, Bilbo sees himself as a hundred percent 'Baggins', a respectful and proper hobbit, but later comes to acknowledge that there might be a bit of the adventurous Took in him after all.There are thirteen dwarves (and a wizard) that Bilbo travels with, a number which I found a bit unnecessary. I think that Tolkien could have used half the number of dwarves and it would still have made the same story. Overflow of dwarves aside, I really enjoyed reading The book.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Adventure stories']

No one should live out their miserable little lives without being able to say, &quot;I've read Catch-22.&quot; This is a true literary masterpiece, a classic through and through, a book so superior I should be ashamed to even try critiquing it. Joseph Heller shows himself a true master of the English language in this spellbinding satire, his look at the nonsense surrounding the logic of the American military system. Catch-22 is brought to life by a remarkably diverse cast of characters, all of them interwoven into a plot that unfolds and comes together with relentless perfection. Heller lets us see not only through the eyes of his main character, the paranoid bombardier Yossarian, but gives us a glimpse inside dozens of other vivid personalities, plunging us into their thoughts and dreams and hopes and fears and desires. Their stories, told with such a sarcastic and surreal edge, go far beyond the bounds of outrageousness, yet the unarguable truth they represent holds the potency of a maxim. Catch-22 is guaranteed to grip you, entertain you, and astound you. Its story is certainly complex, but so profound as to leave you recalling each and every detail as an individual climax.

I'll finish it this time, but now I know why I left the book unfinished that summer. Reading it is turning into a chore.I question whether this book holds up as a classic. True, there are plenty of moments of biting satire and superb black comedy. and yes, the phrase Catch 22 did enter the language and that concept is brilliant. But the book is 400 pages of the basically the same thing over and over. There is virtually no characterization -- Heller is incapable of it -- and not much of a plot either. One cannot keep the characters straight; they all blend together. Yes, it is about war, but Heller/Yossarian really comes across as a misanthrope -- everyone in his world is weird and worthless. I don't want to spend more time with any of them, but I've got two-thirds of a book to go. Voltaire did something quite similar to Catch 22 in Candide, but he kept his story to about 100 pages.

On the con side: the dialogue is unlikely in many places; the names of the characters very unlikely (as though pulled out of the too-creative hat); and a style that skims along a little breathlessly, as though punctuation amounted to grammatical error rather - what it really is - the finest point of style.

Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end, I was much less pleased. I found the book's much-vaunted humor to be tiresome in the extreme, the characters far too cartoonish for me to care when bad things happen, and the entire enterprise to be about twice as long as necessary. Which is not to say there weren't some things to like: the non-linear, non-chronological structure is kind of interesting at times (unlike some, I didn't find it confusing), the convoluted machinations of war profiteer Milo Minderbinder are kind of amusing, and the sly insertion of anachronistic elements to signal that the book is about Korea and not WWII, are all worth mentioning.

B000JQXNSQ,ANIMAL FARM - A Fairy Story (Time Reading Program Special Edition),,,,0/1,5.0,957571200,one of the few books in my life that I will never forget,"Animal Farm is an imaginatively suspenseful novel based on communism and socialism. Although the characters in the story are farm animals, they represent influential figures of the Russian Revolution. In the midst of an unsettling atmosphere between farmer and animals, Old Major, a prize-winning boar, as well as a metaphor of Karl Marx, spreads the idea of a utopian society and a rebellion among the animals. The animals, never before charismatic enough to think of this vision themselves, seize the very first chance that comes up to drive the tyrant farmer Mr. Jones (Czar Nicholas II), his wife, and the farm hands out of the farm. The other pigs feed off his inspiration, and are eventually overcome with greed, using it to benefit themselves, instead of following through on the Old Major's original proposal. In the long and short of it, some pigs lead a revolt against people, act like jerks, and play poker. George Orwell creates a satire in his book Animal Farm, ridiculing the Russian government in the shadow of his words. His book warns against totalitarianism, which is displayed through the pig's slowly growing power over the animals after the riddance of the previous dictator, Mr. Jones. However, this is not the only work portraying Orwell's view of Soviet Communism. His previous novel, 1984 displays yet more depth into the author's view into the so-called idea of a utopian society. He believes ""although socialism is good as an ideal, it can never be successfully adopted due to uncontrollable sins of human nature."" Orwell's fable is a must read, however, to make full sense of this novel, I would only recommend this book to mature audiences of at least thirteen or over.",['Gillian Fenwick'],['Biography & Autobiography']

The characters he depicted were a perfect resemblance to the lead players in the Russian Revolution.With there being several ingrediants to a successful revolution, ANIMAL FARM embodies most of them. The first part of this was a state of crisis. The animals of the farm were overworked, treated poorly, and not fed enough. Such was the case in Russia under the Czar's rule. They needed a leader to guide them through the overthrow. For the animals, it was Snowball and Napoleon; and for Russia, it was Stalin and Trowsky. Orwell creates a genre of the situation that is easier for people to understand.The end is incredibly compelling where the animals would look at the pigs and humans sitting together at the table, and could no longer tell the difference between the two. Stalin had reformed to what he had led a rebellion against, such as the pigs took the likeness of the humans; which they claimed to hate.This book is exceptionally written, and is recommended for everyone to read to get a better understanding of the Russian Revolution.",['Gillian Fenwick'],['Biography & Autobiography']

In the story Old Major calls a meeting of the animals to discuss his dreams. Old Major wants the animals to stop being slaves. Then Major teaches them the Beasts of England song. Sadly, Old Major died, but his dreams were still alive with the animals. Old Major's dream was called Animalism. Next, the humans are run off the farm. The animals are upset because the farmer was not feeding them. Then Napoleon, the leader of the farm, gets rid of Snowball by having &quot;his dogs&quot; attack and chase Snowball off the farm. Also, Napoleon takes away the last signs of the rebellion. He changes the name of the farm back to Manor Farm. Finally, Napoleon and the other pigs turn into humans. They walk on their hind legs, wear clothes, and talk. All in all, Animal Farm is a sad story. I would suggest that adults and teenagers read Animal Farm. One thing I liked about the book was that the animals demonstrated good team work. The animals carried in the harvest and they helped rebuild the windmill that a storm destroyed. Another thing I enjoyed was Old Major's character. All the animals really looked up to him. Finally, I liked the idea of all animals or humans being &quot;comrades&quot;.

I couldn't see the relation between this book and the world of reality (at this stage I had no knowledge of the Russian Revolution(RR)). But when, after countless hours of studying the book in-depth within class, I finally saw how closely the plot of Animal Farm, mirrored events of the RR, so closely in fact that this book could easily be mistaken for being part of the high school History sylabus for study of the RR.But, as this book carries such in-depth meanings concerning communism and morales, I don't believe it makes a good leisure reading book.In order to benefit most from this book, a general knowledge of events within the RR would be essential either before or after you read the book. Some of you may be thinking, why the hell should we read this book to find out about the RR when we're supposed to know about it anyway, but Orwell has entwined events, his own ideas and displays the problems of communism all within a fantasy world where animals take the place of humans and a farm symbolises the country of Russia anfd this to me makes all the difference between a history book and a novel with a factual background.All begins well when the animals adopt the social structure of communism and the farm prospers. But things start going uphill from there as animals, symbolising the workers and commonfolk of Russia, rebel, produce disapears and all animals except the pigs lose more and more responsibility for the organisation of the farm until at last the pigs, symbolising the leaders of Russia, gain complete control of the farm and begin to strip the farm of its produce.Though I had no background knowledge at all on the RR, I predicted the climax of the book from the end of chapter three. So as I read and read, I felt confined and wanted to yell at the animals as I though it was obvious as to how the book would finish and also that the animals seemed so daft because they let the pigs hoodwink them.

Orwell has fullfilled his job to illustrate the developement of dictatorship by giving animals the characters of humans. The novel isn't just a story of some animals living on a farm, their characters refer to real existing humans who lived under the Soviet Communism. The allegory may give away information about the further process and the developement may be obvious sometimes, but the thoughts and feelings of the animals prevent the novel from getting boring. Furthermore there are still some unexpected incidents, i.e. Boxer's death. All in all, Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; is a proclamation against dictatorship and a proclamation for liberty.

It may be too sophistacted for younger children but once you get into it, the book is an amazing combination of action, dialogue and politics.A farm is being over worked. The animals revolt in the beginning of the story. Their take over was surprisingly easy. Of course later in the story the humans come back which takes the form of ""The Battle of the Cowshed,"" and ""The Battle of the Windmill."" Over all, the book has several casualties. One happens because an animal sees a traitor in a dream.This story could be too violent for young children. Toward the middle of the story the pigs start changing the commandments that they wrote before the revolt. Eventually they change the commandments from ""all animals are equal,"" to ""all animals are equal but some are more equal than others.""Later in the story the pigs (who are smarter) learned how to walk and started carrying whips. They did it so gradually the other animals don't notice.The moral of the story is ""power is addictive once you have it you crave more.""

B000JQXNSQ,ANIMAL FARM - A Fairy Story (Time Reading Program Special Edition),,,,0/1,5.0,1041897600,"Deft, well-thought out and wonderful","I just recently finished ANIMAL FARM and loved it. Some other reviewers have criticized it for being too short, but I think the shortness is a good thing. No one wants a book that gives you a lot of fluff and filler nonsense, which ANIMAL FARM never comes close to doing. It is creative, dry, cynical, satirical and to the point. The plot is reinforcing the quote, ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" which is an important point to make to anyone of any age. However, I don't think anyone under the age of a very intelligent, mature 10 or preferably 11 years would be able to appreciate this book to its fullest. A younger child could read it, even though the vocabulary might be confusing, but he wouldn't understand it as deeply. All in all, this is a deep but vastly entertaining read.

In the very beginnings of this book Mr. Jones is very drunk. The animals wait for him tom go in the house and turn the bedroom light off. All the animals had a high rspect for Willingdon Bueaty. That is the name of the prize winning middle- white boar that was OWNED by Mr. Jones. The old pig always liked to share his dreams with the farm animals. He was so respected that all the animals were willing to lose an hours sleep just for him. The animals eventually make a daring attempt to (live better lives)at the old farm.

B000JQXNSQ,ANIMAL FARM - A Fairy Story (Time Reading Program Special Edition),,A3ADCSUJNNIVBV,Franchesca,0/1,5.0,1050105600,Personification,"Animal Farm by George Orwell, is the story of the Bolshevic revolution, told using a farm's corruptness. Each character of the book is representative of one of the major people involved in Russia's dramatic change. The Czar, Lenin, Tratski, Stalin, the government, the working class, followers, and secret police, are all present in this story through animals. Old major a pig (Lenin), brings inspiration to the animals of the farm to take control of their lives. He dies, but Snowball(Tratski) organizes the attack on Mr.Jones (The Czar). After they succeed in riding the farm of Mr.Jones, Snowball makes plans of education and electricity for the future. Meanwhile Napoleon(Stalin), is planning his take over. Napoleon uses Snowball's plans but convinces the animals it is his own and that Snowball is to be banished. Squealer who is always at Napoleon's side goes around convincing everyone that Napoleon really is great. Boxer who is a horse(the working class) works very hard because he is thinking his work will pay off. When he gets injured and can no longer contribute to the progress of the far, Napoleon sends Boxer to a glue factory. The followers are the sheep and the dogs of the farm are the secret government. Anyway, the book is a fun and creative way to teach the Russian Revolution. It is a short and quick read that you can gain a lot from. Although you need to do a little bit of extra research if you don't know anything about the Russian Revolution to understand what everything represents, it is worth it.",['Gillian Fenwick'],['Biography & Autobiography']

The clincher for me was when the pigs started walking on their hind legs. Although I was surprised that the animal's memory was that bad. I always thought that dogs were just as smart or smarter then the pigs. At least my dog is anyway. They seemed like a bunch of idiots that wouldn't know how to eat if they weren't told how too.

The animals feel that they do all the work and it shouldnt be like that, but once the animals take over they have problems of there own. What the animals were trying to stop the humans from doing occured amongst themselves. In the book I really like when the animals fought the humans. The animals are planning tactics and everything to hold off the humans. In the battle of cowshed the animals worked together to defeat the humans even though they did not have any weapons of their own. Rarely you see a point of view like this in other books so it really intriuged me. Also, the battles seemed to be upsets (underdog wins) and I always like to read or watch something like that. I would recommend this to other people around the age of 14 or above. To a little kid all the metaphors in this book would mean nothing more than animals talking and taking over. The book has a point other than just the animals taking over and if you figure out what the meaning is it makes the book mroe enjoable to read.

Of course they have to speculate, seeing as how no one (except God, Himself) knows for sure how and when this will take place. But the speculation is so realistic and well written that readers will question their own preparedness and want to see to their family's salvation issues. As long as we remember that this is a work of fiction, I would recommend this book to anyone who has a hard time understanding what the end times are all about.

But, this book is so inconsequential. There is no substance. The characters are so disconnected from their own experiences and the events around them, their emotions and actions seem pasted on. And the details are non-existent. I think the only people that will enjoy reading this book, or this apparently endless series, will be those who currently believe exactly as the authors do and are seeking capitulation, even if its fictional. This leaves me feeling quite cynical about the authors. They seem to know that there is an audience for this type of material. They'll hit the circuit of televised evangelism and make big money. But, I don't really believe that. The authors have written other books, particularly LaHaye, offering religion based advice on the subjects of married life, family life and mental illness (depression). And I think they want to carry on a ministry in this sort of writing.I'd like to review this book on something other than it's tight fisted religious agenda but, there really is nothing else. I suggest that anyone considering reading this book, first look through a number of these on-line reviews. People in Ministry give many of the lowest ratings, as well as devout lay people and avid fiction readers.I was raised as a Protestant but, I'm completely lost when I read reviews that say this book will inspire people, or make them reevaluate their life. Religious experience is non-existent, the characters are cold and calculating as if they want to make the right deal with God. The basis for salvation is spelled out, not too clearly, by the character Rayford Steele's wife's new found religion and by subsequent events in the book, not exactly a basis for a new, inspired look at life. If you don't buy the concept of redemption as being disappeared out of your clothes and attending funerals where the corpse disappears don't look for anything to sway you in this story. Or, for cripees sake any kind of evidence of &quot;research&quot;. It is really quite comical that a woman on the airplane at the beginning of the book says something like, please find my husband and give him a blanket, he's a religious person and will be embarrassed if he's seen naked. Oh, brother. He's just disappeared out of his clothes, wherever he went, he went in the flesh and naked, too.So, if you're a member of the club and want to believe as the authors do you'll enjoy this book.

Sorry, I've tried twice to like it, but I just don't get it. Granted, I'm pleased that one of the most popular novels of recent years is so incredibly G-rated, but that isn't enough to make it interesting. Simply put, it is obvious that author Jenkins has no notion of how to write dialogue that even remotely resembles the speech of real human beings. I know some evangelical Christians, and they don't talk or behave as the Christian characters in this novel do, ditto for the non-Christian characters. I think the author could profit from simply listening to actual people speaking to each other. I keep hoping that Christian publishers will produce fiction that is not only G-rated, but (even more important, as I see it) somewhat in touch with reality. For me, the characters are so one-dimensional (i.e., uninteresting) and the dialogue so absurd that the ""page-turning"" quality I hear so much about is missing.

They seemed to be so easily trapped by the Christian mindset after such a short period of time, and without thinking for themselves I might add.Also, most of the logic and reason that would make this book work isn't present. The disappearances that occur are supposedly God claiming his ""chosen people"" and taking them into heaven. But, they didn't exactly say until around page 40 who those people were. In fact, the book never said anything directly to any denomination of religion about this entire epic saga until chapter three. Which brings me to my next point: According to this book, only true Christians are taken by God; no one else, just Christians. What about the true Jews or Muslims, or any monotheistic religious peoples? Did God suddenly not like them and cast them aside as inferior? That message became quite clear throughout pages of the book, as the ""true"" religion is proclaimed as Christianity, which made me absolutely disgusted. By the time I finished, I realized that the entire book was nothing more than a heap of religious propaganda, unoriginally written and conceived by two hypocritical ""Christian"" authors. If a Christian has that little respect to other religious and peoples, they don't deserve to be called a Christian, let alone a decent human being.But there's more! The events of the post-rapture are illogical and nonrealistic, as well as what had happened beforehand. The world agrees to three world currencies, and plans to go to one? The United Nations has its members to destroy ninety percent of its weapons, and give the remaining ten to the UN? And all nations seem to agree with this by an overwhelming majority? Thinking that all nations will agree to this is completely ludicrous, and isn't good political writing.So, in conclusion, this book is nothing more than a stockpile of religious propaganda and lies, aimed to scare you for the rest of your life about what will happen to you on this last day of judgment. Unless you liked having this kind of thing shoved down your throat on a daily basis, don't waste your money;","['Tim F. LaHaye', 'Jerry B. Jenkins']",['FICTION']

Guy Montag, a book-burning fireman, obtains a job to achieve the society's highest objective, happiness. In Montag's world, trivial information (as from television) is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy was once happy when he burnt books in the fireproof houses, but this happiness becomes questionable when he meets the new 17-year-old neighbor girl, Clarisse, who is thrilled by the ideas from books and the world around her. Before he met Clarisse (who told him about the past when people were not afraid and firemen prevented fires) Guy never questioned anything. While Guy experiences a faith crisis, his wife spends all day in front of the television wall, with her television ""family."" When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Guy becomes motivated and starts to hide books.

B000K0G43C,Fahrenheit 451,,AA4KGHVGCTRG1,"Little ""Miguelito""",1/1,5.0,1113177600,Moral Teachings,"From the temperature at which books burn, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 illustrates a frightening idea of the future, a future where firemen do not put out fires but start them. Guy Montag, a book-burning fireman, obtains a job to achieve the society's highest objective, happiness. In Montag's world, trivial information (as from television) is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy was once happy when he burnt books in the fireproof houses, but this happiness becomes questionable when he meets the new 17-year-old neighbor girl, Clarisse, who is thrilled by the ideas from books and the world around her. Before he met Clarisse (who told him about the past when people were not afraid and firemen prevented fires) Guy never questioned anything. While Guy experiences a faith crisis, his wife spends all day in front of the television wall, with her television ""family."" When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Guy becomes motivated and starts to hide books. Eventually, Mildred, Guy's wife turns him in and he must either flee or become arrested.Fahrenheit 451 is a novel with many alarming resemblances to our current world.

B000K0G43C,Fahrenheit 451,,A2ENWMGSIJ6QGH,David,1/1,5.0,1114646400,Eerie reflection on our American culture today,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book with incredible meaning for our American culture today. It begins in an unknown city somewhere in America in years and decades directly after the McCarthy era levels of censorship. Media has become the center of American culture, and many people's parlor walls are covered with giant, super-enhanced HDTVs, lowering their level of interaction with each other to almost nothing in respect to both its quantity and its quality. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but he has never actually put out a fire in his life (at least not intentionally). All houses have been permanently fireproofed with plastic sheaths for nearly 50 years, and the jobs of firemen have been changed from protecting the public from fire to ""protecting"" the public with fire. As reality TV, comedy shows and pulp fiction/romance novels became more and more popular, non-fiction and the classics were read less and less until, as Captain Beatty, the fire captain and primary personified villain of the novel, says, ""(Most people's) sole knowledge of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.'"" As public interest in books, newspapers, and other sources of information waned, the school system and general level of education grew less and less complex/competent, until eventually the government took advantage of the situation and began cutting off all books which ""offended"" any minority, no matter how small, proclaiming equal treatment for all and the evils of literature loudly. In order to enforce this ban which the people had so perfectly brought down upon themselves, the government changed the fire department into its secret police, stating that they were protecting the public from the ""harm"" of these books while truly cutting them off from the only source of knowledge able to save them from the impending but largely ignored or unconcerning massive international atomic war. As Guy races against time, the odds, and the power of the government and its incredibly seductive mass media, he attempts to break through to someone, trying to find some way to destroy the killer system before it's too late. Can he destroy the system with the help of an old retired English professor named Faber? Or will Captain Beatty and the government's deadly Mechanical Hound catch up with him first? The playing out and ultimate conclusion of this conflict is an incredibly deep and powerful reflection on our American culture today, and on our seemingly insatiable desire for pleasure and entertainment without having to do any more work or self-education/learning in order to get it than we see as being absolutely necessary. Written in McCarthy era America before the dawn of the television, the rise of televised NFL and ESPN, and the surrealistic and ever growing worlds of video games, movies and the Internet, Fahrenheit 451 predicts with eerie accuracy directions in our culture which 50 years ago would have been regarded as impossible science fiction dystopia, but now are considered an ever growing part of normal daily life. As the quality of our public school system continues to decline, and fast cars, pornography, and having fun with friends quickly become more important than keeping on top of government, state, or even local affairs for the vast majority of the American population, one might stop to wonder between one's job and the entertainments we all seem to live for and rush home to every night why we're doing anything like this-what is it we really value in life? In Montag's world, the sources for those values have been taken away, sacrificed to the peoples' ever-growing and insatiable desire for pleasure. Will--or could--our civilization go the same way, walking blindly to the very edge of a worldwide atomic war? Judge for yourself after reading America's fate in the incredible future-predicting novel Fahrenheit 451.",['Ray Bradbury'],['Book burning']

The lengths the fictional mother goes to to hold and rock her child are humorous, and are a metaphor for the way many mothers feel about their children. (The illustrations showing the son at various stages of his childhood are also humorous.) When the son, as a grown man, later returns the favor and rocks his ailing elderly mother on his lap, the book takes a touching turn as the love is reciprocated. Later, he goes home and rocks his own son. I have read this book numerous times and have never been able to finish it without getting all choked up. Luckily, my daughter understands. It is a wonderful way to show children the &quot;circle of life&quot; and how love is woven through generations.",['Robert N. Munsch'],['Juvenile Fiction']

It is a favorite of mine, my children, my mother, my sisters, my nieces...et cetera. I could go on and on as to the sheer number of people that this book has touched. It so perfectly illustrates the strength of love that a mother has for her child and how that love never lessens or dies, no matter how old or young her child. It also shows that a mother's love can pass on for generations, teaching children to become loving parents themselves through the example of a loving, affectionate parent.However, if you are expecting ""realism"" from this book, you need to look elsewhere. I couldn't get over some of the negative reviews I've read of this book criticizing it for being ""inappropriately unrealistic."" This is a work of FICTION. The author employs different literary techniques in order to help tell his story. A few words and phrases the critics might want to familiar themselves with: Allegory, Creative License and Symbolism, to name just a few. If you don't like the book, you don't like the book. No problem. Different people have different likes and dislikes. But to act like the author is demented and that anybody who likes his book is mentally/emotionally deficient as well is just incredibly ignorant.I believe this is a book for readers who appreciate fairy tales and symbolism, readers who are parents themselves and/or those who have close relationships with their parents. Clearly, there are those that may not be able to grasp the symbolism or the creative license the author uses...but as my own small children have never had trouble with it, I wonder if it isn't because some adults have become too literal-minded and have lost all ability to employ their own imaginations.",['Robert N.

I knew of the book, and so did my wife. For all of you pop culture savvy readers, this is the book that Joey reads at Emma's 1st birthday party on `Friends'. So, we were both kind of excited to see what it was all about (on the show he reads it in parts, so you don't get to hear the whole story) but after reading it we passed if over as nothing more than corny saccharine fluff. I never really planned on reading this book to my daughter much because I personally didn't care too much for it and so I kind of forgot all about it until she pulled it out of her closet and demanded I read it to her. For some reason she loves it and so I wind up reading it at least once a day now.So, to address the concerns many have had about the oddity of the prose, I am with you on that one.Personally I think that the idea behind the book is sweet, but the way it is executed it rather strange. Yes, a mother's love never dies, and likewise the love a son has for his mother is a bond rarely broken, but this is just going too far for its own good. Having the mother sneak into her grown sons window at night to rock him and sing to him just gives me the creeps. Sure, this is a children's book and so there are always those exaggerations, but this is an exaggeration they could have gone without.Maybe they could have had the mother sing to a photograph of her son, or just leave it at the fact that she drove by his house late at night, which while still somewhat creepy is acceptable.I think that the role reversal at the end is really sweet and touching, and when the son goes home and sings to his newborn daughter I actually cried a bit (misty eyes, not water works) and so I can't say that the book isn't moving at parts (and it is nicely illustrated, even if the illustrations are depicting that oddness) but I will say that it is not as moving or touching as it could have been had it been slightly more realistic and palatable.I read it to her because she wants me to, but this is not a book I'd buy for or recommend to other parents I know.",['Robert N.

We were seated so far away from the front microphone, we could not see the illustrations, but the text sounded strange.

There is something wrong with a mother driving across town, using a ladder to get into her son's room, picking him up off the bed and rocking him in her arms whether or not it's a story in a book or something that happens in real life. To me it seems more a story about a mother who has been unable to accept the natural change in the parent/child relationship. One can love their child forever without treating them like a baby their entire life (let alone breaking into their house to do so).We found ""I Will Hold You 'til You Sleep"" by Linda Zuckerman to be a much more appropriate book as it carries the theme of love between parent and child while also showing how the relationship changes as the child grows up.

I wouldn't recommend this book to young readers.The story setting was in the 1930's, around the depression years. The book is about two poor men looking for work,totally opposite characters. One was smart,and small built, while the other was big,strong and mentally handicapped.The Author writes about how the mentally handicapped were treated in those days (1930's)and also how ignorant people were.I don't see much difference in our society.

I was surprised I hadn't ever had to read it in school. The one thing that I really liked about this book was the characterization and dialogue. Maybe I'm reading the wrong authors, but it seems like a lot of dialogue in fiction is too uniform between the characters. Meaning they all pretty much speak in the same way...use the same word choices. In other words, it's like all the characters are really just speaking the way the author would. This book is great because Steinbeck includes all the vocal and character nuances in the dialogue.

Basically, this is one of the most moving, inspiring, and depressing books I've ever read - and also one of the best.

John Steinbeck really explained the life and turmoil of a hobo during the Great Depression. Through his story of Lennie and George, he describes their journey of trying to fulfill his dream. Steinbeck describes in great detail the setting of a ranch in California. The ranch is comprised of a main house, a couple of bunkhouses and a barn.The main characters are the are the hobo's Lenny and George. Lenny is kind of retarded and cannot take care of himself. Lenny is really big with a very bulky frame. George is not very big and takes care of Lenny. He promised Lenny's aunt that he would take care of him. Lenny likes to touch soft things that sometimes get him in trouble.The main idea in the story Of Mice And Men is George and Lenny goes from town to town looking for work. Lenny often allows his urges to get them in trouble. They were running from Weed after Lenny's charged with rape and come to this ranch. George always reminds Lennie that they will ""live of the fatta the land."" (Steinbeck pg. 14). George tells Lenny that the ranch will have ""A kitchen, orchard, apples, and peaches, and a few berries"" (Steinbeck Pg. 57)I would recommend this book to all middle school reading classes.

The usage of his words really depicts the Great Depression (1930's) that led both main characters on their quest to be independent and to live on their own farm. John Steinbeck knows how to hook his readers and keep them on edge. This book takes place in Salinas, California where you can imagine the rolling hills, wildlife, and serene ranches and scattered farms as far as your imagination can take you.The first two characters you meet are Lennie and George. Lennie is a bit slow about the brain. He travels with George. George handles all the business type things while Lennie stays silent. These two are seen throughout the story. When George and Lennie get on their job site (where most of the story takes place), they meet some more people. The first person they meet is the boss. The other characters are Candy, Carlson, Slim, Crooks, Curley, and Curley's Wife. George and Lennie (mostly Lennie) will run into problems. When I read this book, it had me on edge and almost over it! There is also evidence of foreshadowing throughout the book, letting you know that something is bound to happen.

Perhaps it's because of how conservative I am, so I had to do a lot of censoring (as I read near everything aloud, especially when I have to analyze and remember things) during my reading. My teacher got my hopes up, saying it was a heartbreaking story with an incredibly sad ending, but by chapter five of six, I wasn't sure where the sadness was supposed to come in. The last chapter only was about six pages, so the ending itself felt rushed, and because of that, didn't feel very sad at all, which let me down immensely.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson",,

That is, it's not for you unless you've made one important insight...You see, if you plan to read this book you may be in for a surprise. Kind of like the surprise of a review that you're in for considering my rating.I loved this book, and it started, for me, a roller-coaster journey of emotion &amp; thought from my earliest and darkest memories as a squirming tot, right through my last cup o' java.You can have no idea of what's in store for you before you begin this trip. This applies to all of life's travels, after all &quot;life's what happens while you're busy making other plans.&quot;And this novel is no different, but with a special twist. It will be unlike anything you've ever read before.You honestly will open the windows of you're mind into either a chasm-like, fearful place of fog, into which will shine the diffusive rays of sun, illuminating all that's inside, forcing you to examine everything it holds, and become horrified and turn away from the dark terrors it contains, or into a place where you'll find soltice, companionship, and a peace (and I mean that) unlike any which can be imagined or meditated upon.You may be amazed by the things you've accepted to be true, or you may realize that incredible feeling of justification in the knowledge that at least one other person in the world has experienced the same things as you have.Someone has felt the same disgust in the blind leading the blind devotion of society at large, and has been repulsed at each and every sniveling boot-licking gesture of those who live to please others, and never themselves.Upon stumbling across this world contained in The Fountainhead, my personal journey became populated by the idea of hope.Hope that there must be another - that I am not the only one the world coming to these inevitable conclusions about life. It's amazing how freeing that can be...just the idea that I might some day be able to share these feelings with at least one other person.I'm not saying this book will change you're life.Not at all. I will say that it will force you to examine it.It may justify, repulse, comfort, or terrify you.But I can promise that it will never leave you. By ordinary standards, this has no business being considered a novel. I know of no equal sharing such a description.Please E-mail me if you've read it because of this, and if it's been enjoyable you'll want to read Atlas Shrugged next (a book I consider equal to The Book of Revelation - for the western world). And I would also encourage you to get you're hands on the many books in which Ayn Rand has written articles on many current topics, but with a viewpoint unlike any the popular media have the ego to spin.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

Duringone such lecture, he had this to say aboutSoviet-era literature -- &quot;We all know these bulkybest-sellers _All Quiet on the Don_, _Not by BreadPossessed_, and _Zed's Cabin_ -- mountains oftriteness, plateaus of platitudes, which are called 'powerful' and 'compelling' by foreign reviewers.&quot; (p. 8)Nabokov here was specifically referring to the product of the so-called &quot;Social Realist&quot; school of literature -- an admittedly God-awful genre; however, even the most casual perusal of _The Fountainhead_ would convince a sensible reader that &quot;mountains of triteness, plateaus of platitudes&quot; sums up this book quite well, too. And HOW trite and HOW platitudinous _The Fountainhead_ is! Aesthetically, the characters are more wooden than the Black Forest, and as believable as a Grimm Brothers fairytale; the conversation stilted; the plotting clumsy and predictable. As for the &quot;ideas,&quot; these are nothing more than a confused melange of refried Nietzsche, Social-Darwinism, and a near-sociopathic egotism and greed. And perhaps no more damning critique of contemporary America exists, than when one considers that this steaming pile of utter rubbish and its offshoots (Objectivism, libertarianism, the rest of the Rand oeuvre) has become so influential in the lives and thinking of so many Americans.P.S.: I would have given this book a &quot;1&quot; except for two things: 1) _Atlas Shrugged_ is even worse; 2) Ayn Rand HAS done something I thought no writer, no matter how inept, would ever do -- she wrote BORING sex scenes.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

These guys are rationalists? Look at the emotionalism of the comments: &quot;changed my life&quot; or &quot;I model my life&quot; after the characters or &quot;the greatest novel ever written.&quot; Many books (other than this one) have moved me, given me inspiration, or made me rethink my perspective: none has ever served as a blueprint for my life - the very claim reeks immaturity.In fact, the claims made for this book are the same ones made for religious texts: that is why the reviews hit one end of the other of the spectrum. You're a believer or you're not. And belief has little to do with rationalism or individualism.I have dipped into Rands nonfiction as well. Before you judge her philosophy, it is advisable to read some real philosophy, or perhaps Durrant's History of Western Philosophy. Why? Even Rand's supposed objective work is mainly occupied with trashing everyone who came before her as an &quot;irrationalist&quot; or &quot;collectivist.&quot; Before you dismiss Descartes, Kant, and Sartre, you had best gain some familiarity with their works.Of course, it takes TIME to read real philosophy and it is difficult to understand - which is something that can't be said for Rand.

Critics complain that Howard Roark, and the inevitability with which he rises to pre-eminence, are superbly unfit for the real world. This is true. Howard Roark, however, is not a person and perhaps not even a hero, but an abstract ideal. He is a model of matchless integrity and personal excellence (to a fault), and as I see it the book's premise is that these qualities -- that what is right -- will be recognized and accorded their due in the end. Thus, the good are the pure, those without compromise. Personally, I don't believe Rand even meant the book to suggest that this should, or does apply on planet Earth. Certainly, the theory is ludicrous and circular when applied in reverse to suggest that whatever becomes pre-eminent must have become so because it is inherently excellent and therefore should be allowed to remain so if it can (a theory with which some oppose the anti-trust case against Microsoft). In fact, I think history provides more examples in which those who are pre-eminent have used their power to squelch those who are excellent and right, often successfully. At any rate, I recommend The Fountainhead to anyone and everyone; read it, but take from it what you will.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']
B000MOM96M,The Fountainhead,,A107C4RVRF0OP,Steve,58/87,4.0,948931200,Awe-inspiring but unrealistic,"Amazing how most reviews either award five or one star. Its been five years since I read The Fountainhead as a senior in high school. Like many other impressionable youths, I was lured hook-line-and-sinker into her simplistic world of Roarks and Keatings. Of course, her philosophy, in its uncompromising form, is unworkable (indeed undesirable) in the real world. But that by no means suggests that we should discard it entirely. Rand has a lot to say about the strength and nobility of the human spirit and the independence of the human mind. The world would be a better (and more interesting) place were more people to follow some of her initiatives. Of course, her novel was meant as thinly-veiled philosophical propaganda. For that very reason, it is presented as black-and-white, like a checklist of rules for a happy life. To follow her philosophy blindly would be silly and immature. Philosophy exists only in the human mind. When one tries to apply it to real life, the smart person will always do so with a grain of salt.When it comes down to it, Rand wrote an important book, developed original characters, and a told strong, compelling story. Whether or not one agrees with her philosophy, these are good enough reasons to award it at least four stars.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

It was a great surprise to me to discover that this book was written in the first half of the century and moreover by a woman. Nor the subject, nor the style of writing can indicate this. The subject is timeless. I can understand some don't like this book very much because in this real world we don't often meet people like Roark. He belongs to a novel.

He looks at pain in the same way that he looks at everything else; as something to be understood, and then move on. I particularly liked Roukes response to evil, when the unscrupulous Ellsworth T. asks him at a party &quot;What do you think of me&quot;? Rouke replys, &quot;I never think of you&quot;. Rouke is very unique in this repect. He seems to be able to step outside himself and look at the irrational objectively. Once he understands it; it becomes impotent to hurt him any longer.Evil and pain don't rate very high in Rouke's life. Whereas many of my friends, aquaintences and family members constantly horriblize over events that happened years ago. They carry these painful events around with them like prized battle scars. They refuse to try to understand them. They are not curious in the lest about the nature of their own suffering, and therefore, never solve them; keeping their suffering as the only evidence that they are alive.Rouke, on the other hand, rejects suffering as a way of life. And for this reason he is able to live a happy life and achieve his highest values.

And although I wouldn't say that I was an Ayn Rand fanatic, I did read quite a bit of her work. At this point in my life The Fountainhead wouldn't have quite the same meaning that it did to me at age seventeen. However, I think that I still could appreciate aspects of the novel, which is certainly a modern classic, though some might say (and some might be really offended by this term), a cult classic. What comes to mind for me looking back is the strength of the protagonists and the really powerful way in which the author portrayed each character. For me as I read the book, the characters really came to life. Although I may not have understood it completely or caught nuances that might be apparent to me now, the characters were very well developed. Thinking back on the novel, what must have resonated strongly for me was the bravery, the belligerence, and the independent spirit embodied by Howard Roark and Dominique Francon. To my adolescent thinking these were really admirable and essential qualities, and even now I appreciate aspects of the integrity of their characters. Also I think that there is something in the novel that hooks into an environmental ethic. Though certainly the rape scene embodies an opposite spirit. If I were to recommend any of her work, it might be The Early Ayn Rand, because the stories seem to come from a less extreme and polar place than the later works that I have read, and they reveal an intelligent, articulate, tenacious, and developing author and artist.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

B000MOM96M,The Fountainhead,,,,0/0,4.0,987984000,One man versus Altruism - al_94930@yahoo.com,"The Fountainhead is a story of one man, Howard Roark - Ayn Rand's ideal man- and it is the story of how he fights the natural tendency of our world toward collectivism. Roark is a lone creator in a world of fakers, followers and phonies.For those out there who follow a religious sect who believe in compassion and altruism as lofty goals - the atheistic objectivist credo of Ayn Rand may be hard to swallow. For me, it was not difficult at all. In fact, I had no difficulty at all reconciling Howard Roark with my religious beliefs. Simply, God and the highest ambitions and accomplishments of a creative individual, to me, are one and the same. Compassion and pity are not the loftiest Godly virtues in my world. I can reconcile compassion with objectivism.In my religious world, individualism and achievement reign supreme. Compassion does exist but is secondary. Simply, the American experiment works so well because it has done a masterful job of balancing both fundamental needs of man: the need to create in an unfettered environment(liaises faire capitalism) and the need to believe in God. Ayn Rand's objectivism is a necessary antidote to our present condition to help restore the balance in a world where altruism is becoming the highest ideal. Although Ayn Rand is a proclaimed atheist, I do not think it is impossible to be both an objectivist and a believer. Man does not have to destroy the greatness in the individual to be God-like. One does not have to be a sociopath to be like Howard Roark. (One reviewer called Roark a sociopath and I totally disagree.) Roark has no use for most of the world and unlike the warped sociopath, he does not scheme to get his way - he merely works and achieves. The textbook sociopath feeds off the sickness of the world and achieves through cunning and deceit. Perhaps Wynand could be considered sociopathic, Toohey - definitely - but not Roark. His selfishness is the virtuous kind - directed toward creation. If one is religious - Roark is god-like and of course, blasphemous to the secular and non-secular priests - like Toohey - that are not willing to allow another god in their presence. (Toohey's god is power.)In this novel, Ayn Rand describes her philosophy of objectivism through the interactions between characters. Peter Keating, an architect, achieves greatness by copying others. He is immoral and despite wealth and seeming success, his life is empty. He is the ultimate user and hypocrite. Keating is the immoral user that is the antithesis of the moral hero of the objectivist philosophy.But Rand does not favor altruism as an answer to immoral deeds. In fact, altruism itself is evil because a society, which fosters it, always does so at someone else's expense, and that someone is, as in Roark's case, the true creator and ndividual. This warps and compromises the rightful way of things and inevitably leads us down the path to collectivism. In the person of Ellsworth Toohey, a sociopathic newspaper columnist, Ayn Rand shows how the power hungry manipulate the masses by setting a standard of mediocrity which fosters collectivism. Altruism is a favorite method of manipulation.In our own time, over 50 years after the original publication of the Foutainhead, we can see how in the name of altruism, greedy and soulless politicians are still selling us an Altruistic nirvana. What started as an altruistic call to help the underclass and the oppressed, Affirmative Action and other programs of its like have become programs of evil. Though well intentioned, Affirmative Action programs allow the mediocre to take the place of the best and the brightest in our schools and other institutions. And the sickness is not merely that it advances the stupid and slow among us. There are some very bright but terribly misguided people who think that Affirmative Action is a good thing. Out of guilt and the need to conform, many intelligent people have been led astray as well. And for the people of color who think it is a good thing - it is nothing more than the face of slavery in a new costume.So, in the end, Roark's passion for his work and uncompromising creativity in accomplishing his professional goals set him apart from the second-handers - the same one's that feed off the creativity of the greats thinkers of history: the Galileos, the Edisons, and yes, even our modern Prometheus - the Edward Tellers of the world!Roark is a hero because he will never compromise despite enormous pressures to do so. Although many argue about the necessity to compromise depending upon circumstance, compromising to misplaced altruism or the forces of evil leads to immorality, or fascism, or downright stupidity. Does anyone really want to be operated on by an Affirmative Action brain surgeon?Roark did not sell out. He is certainly a valuable model in this world of immoral leaders and corrupted politicians willing to sacrifice even the greatest among us for their collectivist agendas.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

Ayn Rand, who was born Alice Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1904, wrote captivating dialogical novels every bit as detailed and interwoven as the novels by Dostoevsky--though significantly more affirmative.She constructed her characters in a similar manner to the way in which Victor Hugo constructed the characters of his novels; that is, she created a smorgasbord of characters representative of different ideals whereby each one consciously and/or subconsciously acts in accordance with a specific philosophy and sense of life.As in real life, some of her characters vacillate between contradictory principles. Her main characters, however, are ""ideal"" types. In the course of the narrative they are brought together in situations in which their integrity is tested.This novel demonstrates how some people gauge their self-worth according to how others view them. Some rely on the evaluation of the opaque ubiquitous majority; some feel they need to subordinate others to themselves.

I think that alot of people misunderstand the fountainhead. People seem to get hung up on the fact that Rand's characters don't seem to be human or the idea of selfishness being a better virtue than selflessness. Rand has never claimed that her characters were ment to be acurate representations of people. They were meant to show her ideal man, they are to be ideals to look up to. Her ideas about selfishness deal with a meaning much broader than the common definition especially in connection with greed. I believe the reason she makes all of the characters who would be called selfish the heros is because to her selfishness goes with integrity, not sacrificing yourself to the justifications of other people. Her characters are people unto themselves who do not feel that they owe anything to any one and that no one owes anything to them.",['Ayn Rand'],['Architects']

But it is one of the most interesting, most colorful, and most insightful books I've read in a long time.The book is ostensibly about a railroad executive who finds that she needs to fight to get the freedom to do what is in her best interest. Obstacles, from the incompetance of her brother, the railroad's president, to the government's insistence to enact &quot;People's legislation&quot;, frustrate her and her fellow indistrialists. Eventually, the government's meddling causes widespread dissonance in the economy, and, eventually, to a breakdown of transportation, food distribution, etc. The mythical figure of John Galt, a slang phrase (&quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;), used to convey a feeling of hopelessness, figures in the plot as she tries to track down the origin of the phrase. The book spirals into a succession of exiciting events, and you have a full range to choose from: political power plays, factory riots, mine explosions, physical torture, you name it.The high points of this book are not merely good, but great. As another reviewer pointed out, damned if she doesn't make steel production and railroad operations exciting! The above synopsis sounds a bit heavy-handed--more on that later--but everything is done gradually and piecemeal so that you're halfway through a crisis before you stop to think about its consequences.That said, this book really attempts to do two things at once. It attempts to tell a great story, and it attempts to establish and preach Rand's philosophy. In the first count she does exteremly well. With a few exceptions, every page is significant and exciting. This, from a book that is over 1,000 pages long! The exceptions, however, are the few monologues that permeate the book just enough to make it notable but not enough to drag the story down. The famous diatribes--most notably Fransisco's &quot;money&quot; speech and the 80-page (!) radio address--are not nearly as eloquent or interesting as many Rand followers believe it to be, though the points are quite valid.And--this is a nitpick, to be sure--I dislike books that overuse noted words. For &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; it was &quot;Phoney;&quot; in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; it's &quot;looter.&quot; Everyone's a looter in AS: It's true, but everyone uses the word so much that it becomes meaningless.As a philosophical tome, Rand does the job, I'd say, 80 to 90 percent as it should be. Her arguments are convincing, they are not &quot;extreme,&quot; though I will admit that she's quite inflexible. A is A, as she says, and anything deviating from that--i.e., anyone that disagrees with her--is absolutely wrong and not worth thinking about. I agree with most of it, but with the Rand followers I talk to, there's no argument--it's Rand or nothing.Translated in book terms, the story supports her philosophy, and you don't know it--no &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; bash-over-the-head nonsense. I wouldn't quite call it subtle, but it doesn't turn you away. The only disappointment is during the radio address, when Rand discusses religion (to which she is violently against)--this seemed to be soapbox preaching, not because it's about religion, but because religion was not an issue *at all* throughout the book. (at least directly; Rand supporters would argue it's essential to her philosophy. That may be true, but it's bad prose.) It's as if she forgot about it, so at the last minute stuck it in.In the end, though it is well worth the read. Be prepared to skip a few pages now and then--and don't let anyone tell you they didn't--but it's not necessarily because it's boring. This book is anything but boring.",,

What happens when more people consume than produce? What are the implications of the mindset that simply because one breathes, one is entitled to just as much as the next person? These questions and more are answered in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.Set in the mid-1900s, this is a thrilling novel that, through a logical course of events, illustrates the extreme dangers of a communistic society. Written in the third-person, the novel follows the lives of several characters, especially Dagny Taggart, a vice president at a major transcontinental railroad.The country is being bled dry by people who don't produce and who take from those who do. People have forgotten the relationship between productivity and reward. Communistic behaviors prevail as far as the eye can see.The only ones keeping society from collapsing are those who are hated most - the producers. Their pride and responsibility are inspiring, but even they have limits. As more resources are squandered through stupidity, the government tightens restrictions on production, with Dagny and other powerhouses taking the brunt of it. The more that is destroyed by the stupid, the more that is demanded of the intelligent.Curiosity and exasperation eventually lead Dagny to investigate a man named John Galt, whom no one seems to know anything about, but who may hold the fate of the world in his hands. During the course of her search, there are enough twists and turns to keep one interested. The ending instills a sense of bliss, to say the least, and is well worth reading the entire book.I recommend Atlas Shrugged to anyone who can read, and the audiotape for anyone who can't, or won't. At 1,168 pages, it will take a while to finish, but the sense of purpose you gain from this book makes every minute well spent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is that it was written in the 1950s, yet we can already see in our own society elements of the future it portrays, a future that chills my bones.",,

Although I havent read nearly enough to make a great judgment on whether this is one of the best books of the 20th century or not I highly doubt that I would put it up there if I had read more. Ayn Rand's philosophy has some good ideas that I agree with. Ideas such as the one that one should honour only people's virtues and not their faults for example. Some other aspects of her philosophy seem to me to be misguided however. For example, while organized religion certainly has some faults I do not believe that it's ultimate goal is the unhappiness of everyone and that it is a philosophy of ""death"" that they preach. I am certainly not a very religion person but to totally rip into religion as Ms. Rand does seems unjustified, at least she does not present adequate justification to me. Also, even if everyone followed Ayn Rand's desired trading code I doubt the world would be perfect. I mean some people just can't produce wealth because they were born with mental or physical disabilities or what have you.The way the book was written made it difficult to read for extended sessions. I agree with other reviewers who say that the characters are pretty one-dimensional and I found them almost to be more like robots than humans. The main characters are pretty good at everything too, as if they have no faults. Not only can they produce amazing industrial achievements but they can also drive perfectly and fire weapons masterfully. One chapter of the book is a 70-page monologue that is almost unbearable. It doesn't help that the same ideas are re-hashed over and over and over. Rand really overdoes it when trying to get her point across.

B000MOOAJG,Atlas Shrugged,,A3OZHR830G7H2U,"Walrus Rex ""rexferal""",5/8,4.0,1228780800,Worshiping the false gods of fairness and compassion,"SPOILER ALERT! Let's start here. Ayn Rand is not a great writer. As proof I offer the following comparison. I read recently that a survey had indicated that this book was voted the book that had changed more people's lives second only to the Bible. Rand cannot touch the beauty of the language in the Bible (and I say that as a nonreligious person). Her language is more the utilitarian language of business which is perhaps fitting given that both the subject matter of this novel and Rand's highest ideal is business.That is not to say that this is not a good book, because it is. It is almost awe-inspiring that writing in the late fifties she predicted where we are today. When I first read this novel some thirty years ago, I thought that she was exaggerating the danger, that the US could never go pure nuts and, in worshiping the false gods of fairness and compassion, we would legislate ourselves into poverty and weakness. I stand corrected. Rand predicted the death of truth in journalism, the arrogant pseudo-intellectual rot in government and academy, and the use of junk science to promote socialism. Her characters spout drivel just our leaders spout drivel today. For example, a failed banker who took down the economy of an entire state with the bankruptcy of his bank because he ran it as a banker with a heart rather than by financial calculation, brags that he never made a profit. Our current president-elect, the former community organizer, similarly seeks to rule with a heart by looting from those who earn and promising to give to those who need and who can brag that he has never made a profit, or contributed anything of value to the community. As I write this, the heads of the big three automobile companies are coming hat in hand to the congress to beg for $25,000,000,000 or more based upon their need, not their value, and argue, in essence, that they are too big to fail. As Rand predicted, the looters and the moochers are reigning supreme.Rand failed to foresee a few of the looters and moochers tactics, most notably the cult of multiculturalism/diversity/political correctness and the environmental hysteria, particularly the global warming fraud.Rand's solution, however, is the problem. The plot is that the movers and shakers stop moving and shaking thus causing the economy to collapse thus forcing the looters and moochers out of power and allowing free market capitalism to prevail. There are several problems with this starting with that it is unlikely that the looters and moochers would ever see the error of their ways and get out of the way. On the contrary, the more failure their economic solutions cause, the more excuse they have for implementing ever more radical looting and mooching. (Obama's soon to be chief of staff, Rahm Emmanuel expressed this as, ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before."") Nor has it historically been the case that the looters and moochers go quietly into this good night. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, for example, has looted and mooched the former breadbasket of Africa into absolute economic collapse (an inflation rate of hundreds of millions percent) and, although everybody else may be starving, Mugabe is doing just fine, thank you very much.Further, closing up shop and retiring to the great unknown is not an option unless individuals own the businesses outright. However fed up with regulation and taxation the president or chairman of the board of GM or any other big corporation may be, they can't just shut her down. The shareholders aren't going to let that happen.Finally, Rand's solution is suspiciously like the old sixties mantra of tune in, turn on, and drop out. That is what John Galt and the other heroes do. They go play in the woods in the Rocky Mountains and feel good about themselves while conducting economic sabotage just like the hippies did. Groovy, man.Notable by its absence, and questioning the viability of the Rand vision of economic heroism, is the parent-child relationship. None of the heroes have any children nor time to raise them. There is a fairly long discussion of Dagny and James Taggart's childhood, and shorter references to those of Francisco d'Anconia and Eddie Willers. References to their relationships with their families are largely limited to hero worship of ancestors, such as Nat Taggart, and acknowledgment of their parents' cluelessness, such as Dagny's mother (who is never named). Rand's vision doesn't require, perhaps doesn't allow, child rearing. (I don't believe that Rand herself had any children.)

Unfortunately, I can only give it 2-stars out of 5.The most positive aspects of the book were Rand's colorful descriptions (e.g. city scenes) and strong use of similes and metaphors. She is a decent writer, but mostly around the way she describes things, not in plot creation or character development. That's about all I can say on the positive side.I should mention that I agree with the vast majority of Rand's philosophies, including her concepts around selfishness, libertarianism, her beliefs on theism, and generally speaking I agree with her ideas on objectivism. So don't mis-read this review as not agreeing with her philosophies, as many negative reviews on this book are. This is a primarily negative review on the novel itself! To keep this short (a statement Rand has probably never mouthed):* The book could have been easily cut in half...it's entirely too long for its relatively basic storyline and utter lack of character development* The entire 1168-page book only contains 2 character types--the handsome, intelligent, well-spoken, objectivist ""good guys"", and the sniveling, conniving, unattractive, slinky, back-handed, WHINY ""bad guys"". It's entirely too black and white...EVERY character in the book falls into one of those two categories. The lack of a middle ground or of varying personalities makes the book quite unrealistic and, frankly, *boring*. Every leading man in the book has the exact same personality, which Dagny shares. No wonder Dagny went from seeing Francisco to Rearden to Galt, given that they all have the exact same personality! And every one of the ""bad guys"" has the maturity level of a teenager...whining, pleading, groveling, crying, begging, etc. I mean how the heck did James Taggart ever get commissioned to run a public company like TT? He didn't seem to have a single business skill, nor any mental fortitude whatsoever. Furthermore, I hardly know anyone who has this weak and groveling of a personality, yet in the novel, almost all of the Americans do including every single member of government (conveniently). The dialog that came out of the sniveling ""bad guy"" crowd was soooo tiresome to listen to--I don't know about the 50s but people just don't talk like the people in this book...AT ALL. But again the biggest point here is that I've never read a novel where there were only 2 personalities in the entire book, much less in an 1168-page one!* The book is set in some sort of pseudo-United States. I say ""pseudo"" because there doesn't appear to be a president, nor any checks and balances in any of the government arms that are changing the laws around so spuriously. It actually doesn't even appear to be a democracy, as nobody ever even mentions voting or impeaching the government out, even as the country is going to hell in a hand-basket. It was so un-America like that I'm not clear on why she set the novel in America...it would've been more realistic to put it somewhere that was less of a free society already. Speaking of which, what's happening to the rest of the world in the novel while America is falling apart? Why aren't these horrible conditions in America just driving Americans to move to Canada or back to Europe?? Instead they're committing suicide and starving? Huh??* John Galt's 60-page monologue over the radio was absolutely **painful** to wade through. It could've been 3-4 pages and covered everything quite nicely. How unbelievable, too, that any of the ""sniveling"" crowd would actually sit and listen to the esoteric and labored ramblings of Galt for 3 hours on the radio? I'm not even sure a rabid NPR listener would sit through more than a few minutes of that speech. Yet somehow, even though nobody knows a single thing about Galt prior to the radio broadcast, somehow he's practically a God (certainly a savior type) after the speech, and the government guys want to give him full control over everything. Huh?? Interestingly, I thought there were some pretty deep parallels to Galt and Jesus Christ throughout much of the book, other than Galt was saved during HIS crucifixion.* Interesting side-note: in almost 1200 pages, there were no children mentioned in the book. None. Certainly not by name, and really not even as a concept. Though many of the characters in the book were married (none happily), none had children. Just thought that was interesting, and really for me I think it subconsciously lent to the whole environment being not-believable (along with many other factors, most covered in this review). Where are the kids Ms. Rand?* Also interesting that the person who led a company in this book pretty much WAS the company. Dagny was TT, Rearden was Rearden Metal, Francisco was Anaconia Copper, etc. That person was so critical to the company that just leaving the company was enough to practically destroy it. It was like there were just a few dozen (or perhaps a few hundred) worthwhile employees in the entire country, and once they went to the valley, along with some economic policy changes, everything fell apart within months. It was just entirely too dramatic of a scene, and the main individuals in the book had way too much ability to make their company succeed or fail. Keep in mind these were among the biggest companies in the country. If the CEO of Coca Cola disappeared, somehow I think the company would be OK.I could keep going, but I won't. The most summarizing statement I could say about this book is that it's very weak as a novel, as it attempts to surround and support Rand's strong philosophical ideas. Ms. Rand should have just stripped the ""novel"" part out of the book and presented it as a 100-150 page treatise on objectivism, like some of her non-fiction works. That would have served two important purposes: (1) letting the reader know upfront that they're reading a bland philosophy book (as opposed to them thinking they'll be reading a page-turning novel), and (2) shortened the book 10-fold, which heaven knows this book desperately needed.",,

It is far too easy to read Rand and easily identify with her ideals of justice without considering how these things might actually shape up were they instituted in real life. One other review I read elsewhere said that ""her main accomplishment is her ability to make the unwary or slightly-informed reader feel superior to every one else he knows or meets. Thus, for young people, this book can produce bothersome results ... for a long time."" As I was well into my 40's when I first read the book (just to discuss it with a friend over email) I did not get to experience this phenomenon firsthand, but I find exactly that sort of attitude given by several young reviewers here on Amazon. This is in no way intended to be an ad hominem statement - I'm just making objective observations.It is easy to get excited or ""all het up"" about new ideas, especially when they seem to address the deep problems of the world. However, the more mature and perhaps more sober mind will ask why then hasn't it been discovered before? And therein lies the rub, and what is wrong with Rand's book. As others have noted in various ways, one just can't live her philosophy - because it's just not made for actual humans. And that is what I would like to focus upon here in this review.How is it, for instance, that common people and government people tend toward cravenness while businessmen (and -women) are immune to such vice and are indeed paragons of virtue? What kind of person finds such measure of satisfaction from the production of excellence and the receiving of just pay for such production that he is never tempted to try to get more for his work than it is worth? What kind of person will bow down and worship the idea and ideal of money as his guiding principle in life taking the utmost care never to violate it either by asking too much of it or by producing even slightly shoddy work? I sincerely hope the movie will make an attempt to portray a truly ""Objective"" person; I suggest such a person will be rather inhuman.Notice that Rand is trying to say we should be virtuous, we should be just, and we should never ask too much or give too little. We did not need Rand to tell us that. There are numerous tales out there of the how and why of human weakness and imperfection. Perhaps one of the most widely known is the one in the book of Genesis of Adam and Eve's fall from grace. So Rand's observations are not in any way new or even surprising - we are pretty sorry in many ways! But her novel proposed ""cure"" takes away much more than it offers by inverting traditional interpretations of virtue and vice.It is most helpful, I think, to realize that Rand came of age during the post-Czarist Russian times and like many young people was heavily influenced by the tenor of times as she grew into adulthood. She may well have found herself no longer able to put any trust in any social institutions and conventions and turned to the individual as the source of meaning, since that may well have been all with which she found herself left. I can only have any sympathy for her ideas using this idea as a frame of reference.Now to my specific critique of her ideas. There are many objections that I could raise, but I intend to look at only a few.The first I've already mentioned: how and why are business people to be trusted when government and the common rabble cannot be given this same trust? How can Rand avoid a charge of elitism here? Where is the guarantee that business people will actually keep faith in what I'll call the ""God of economics"" and never ever abuse the power that money gives them? Look at the current post-banking-scandal world in which we live. I'm afraid that the current times strongly point to the idea of universal human weakness. I see people as worshiping the having of money, not the ideal of it. Rand is simply out of touch with real, actual, living, imperfect people here.Secondly: How are we to start the process of getting only that which we earn? An infant or child cannot deserve anything yet. Rand (hypocritically, I believe) dodges this issue by claiming that it's not really ""sacrifice"" when giving is directed toward one's children. This is plain nonsense to anyone who has been around children ... in case one's own childhood is forgotten. And I find it creepy to contemplate what will happen to the old people - a society of euthenasia seems inevitable.Thirdly: What would a real person look like that embodied Rand's Objectivist virtues? Imagine one whose highest goal in life is to produce as well as he can. I do not for a moment suggest that excellence is not a good thing. But I just can't imagine getting the kind of totality of satisfaction from such activity that Rand ascribes to it. No matter how good I am or how good my production, I'll always be reaching or hungering for a vague ""more"" in life, as nothing I accomplish can possibly fill the deep hunger within. I would suggest that whatever Rand's ideal Objectivist would look like to me and many others, such a person would be a very narrow individual indeed.Finally, the very premises of her philosophy seem a bit mutually contradictory, and it is here that I make my most fundamental objection. She essentially espouses a radical individualism. But any philosophy that purports to making the individual his own measure cannot allow itself to make any further prescriptions, as this authority has been radically handed over by the philosopher to the individual who puts the philosophy into practice. How can she first say it is within the authority of the individual to pursue his happiness and then say one can never use a person as a means to an end? What if I as an individual can't or won't accept the idea that achievement will produce happiness? How can I as an individual follow my own counsel and then accept the rest of Rand's philosophy, if I happen to think it will not serve my ends?As I see it, the premises of her Objectivism stand somewhat independent of one another and require some sort of encompassing principle if they are to be seen as a cohesive whole. In other words, Objectivism must be taken as a kind of religion rather than a set of conclusions that might be drawn by many a reasonable person independent of belief. Another way of saying it is to point out that there exist no self-evident truths that can be automatically universally accepted by anyone exerting his or her raw intelligence. Therefore, the individual no longer is the true master of his destiny.These are some of the things that I have against Rand's philosophy. Notice the ""Objective"" nature of my complaints as opposed to weak ad hominem ""people don't give her a fair shake"" kind of reviews I've read here. I've noticed that serious readers easily find specific things to say against Rand's thinking, which truly seems rather underdeveloped. The above-mentioned typically younger crowd tends to be less critical. I'm hoping that any comments my review attracts will be objective (if not Objectivist) and specific, because I believe that precise criticism of the subject at hand will better serve the potential readers of Rand's works, keeping in mind the nature of this forum.I find myself wondering, too, if Rand's atheism doesn't perhaps make her react against typical religiously upheld virtues such as personal sacrifice and charity toward those in need. It is easier for me to accept, for instance, her assertion that people should be paid only what they deserve if she didn't also mention that the traditional virtues are not only unneeded but actually evil. Her posture here makes me wonder what unstated premises really form the basis of her arguments. As much as atheists like to fancy themselves bias-free, I have never found this to be the case. No one is bias-free, because any coherent argument must flow from premises that are ultimately neither provable nor disprovable.Potential readers should be prepared for a long read that often becomes rather heavily didactic, frequently long and drawn out, and in one case (the exposition of Rand's philosophy using John Gault's pirated radio broadcast as a vehicle) an expository rant of such ponderous and tedious verbiage to severely test the patience of the most dedicated reader. I believe in this last case Rand was trying to make sure that her readers got the full benefit of every pearl of her wisdom; it's up to the individual to decide if she succeeded, and I would say she could have made her case with the spillage of a great deal less of ink.I did like Part I, as it had the feel of a cosmic mystery in the making. I will concur with other reviewers who objected to the often clumsy feel of the writing, but that really didn't bother (or entertain) me excessively. I will also concur with the accusation that Rand's protagonists were idealized and that she made straw men of her anti-heros - but I will not object, as this kind of literary technique has been widely used by others as a means of conveying their arguments. Similarly the length of the book per se didn't bother me - and I read every single word of every page.In summary: worth reading not because of its intellectual clarity or worthwhile content, but because of its appeal to a wide portion of society. Understanding Rand's ideas and recognizing their wide appeal certainly gives insight into the society in which we live.",,

It is amazing how timeless this book is! More importantly, in this era we now find ourselves in, of big government and the demeaning of private enterprise, Ayn Rand's politics resound. While I am not a fan of her promotion of atheism, a philosophy more engrained today in the hearts of the big government political elitists, I am a fan of her promotion of the businessman. For some odd reason, the weaker politicos in Washington are almost always compelled to repress capable men and women around the country in their endeavors, be it through the second highest corporate income taxes in the world (currently right behind Japan) or through prohibitive legislation. Rand would recognize the drive toward nationalism we are currently seeing in our country (banks, insurance companies, hospitals, you name it). She wrote about and predicted this in Atlas Shrugged (published in 1957), and experience it first hand as a child when the Soviets took over her fathers store in St. Petersburg, Russia during the October Revolution. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand describes the chaos of a society growing ever more dependent on a weak and bigger government. The story itself is engaging, but the lessons for today are unavoidable. I highly recommend this read, along with Amity Shlaes ""The Forgotten Man"" in tandem. We need to have strong voices of dissension toward bigger government.",,
B000MOOAJG,Atlas Shrugged,,A3AGPLBM0MPJ93,John C. Reilly,7/16,1.0,1320105600,Nietzsche said it first...and better,"Rand's philosophy, as stated in Atlas Shrugged, is basically that the world is run by talented super-geniuses (like Gault) without whom all productive activity would stop. Due to the burden of the parasitic class, including the government, these super-geniuses decide to flee to a valley, away from such moochers where their mental gifts are free to be unleashed. On the other hand, you have Nietzsche who espoused a view of the unrestrained Will as being represented by the Over-Man, the super-human who has dominion over the world because he is strong and is expressing his will, and there are weaker individuals, who adhere to a slave-morality who try to stop the Over-Man. He wrote this in 1883.True he was not writing about an economic system, but neither does Rand. To believe her philosophy you have to turn economics into a morality play, where only the righteous and good succeed, and the weak parasitic leechers fail and deserve to fail. It's beyond an economic system, let alone a capitalistic one. It's not as if the free market exists in a vacuum. A market, businesses, producers all rely on common space (highways, access to markets, a peaceful society) that they do not pay for directly, nor would they if they weren't coerced by...I don't know the government.In order to have a functioning market, there have to be rules that buyers and sellers agree on. When the seller bribes the judge, or the tax collector, it's not free, and yet that's the hallmark of capitalistic enterprise. So-called producers are allowed to become too big to fail. So big, in fact, that they end up buying the rules. Oh, you have a small business and have to pay taxes and follow regulations, you're not a capitalist, just a sucker. Walmart and Exxon get a tax rebate and make their own regulations--that's capitalism.Ruthless capitalist isn't a myth. To succeed in business, beyond merely making a better product (and lets face it, how often does that happen) you have to be a tyrant--squashing your friends and crushing your enemies.

But seriously, this book blew my mind to oblivion. Even those who are awake will find something in here to connect to.I've read a few reviews that complain Eckhart doesn't have any new ideas. While true, that isn't the point; he can explain the unexplainable in such a remarkably pithy way. We need a conscious population...now more than ever. In my opinion, we need more books by more enlightened beings, each with their own way of explaining the same experience. The more people that can explain this information to the masses, the better chance we'll have for a ""New Earth.""Echkard Tolle wrote the most clear and concise explanation of the ego I've seen to date. And to write with such detail, he would have had to let go of his ego to see it as clearly as he has. He talks about the ego's function through childhood, parenthood, addiction and other stimulii.I'm a quote geek, so here are some of my personal favorites from the book...and this is just a fraction of them.""Non-resistance, non-judgement and non-attachment are the three aspects of true enlightenment""""Attachment to things drop away when you no longer seek to find yourself in them.""""Even if you defeat your opponent, the unconsciousness will simply have moved into you, or the opponent reappears in a new disguise.""""Whenever you feel superior or inferior to someone; that's the ego in you.'""The more shared past there is in a relationship, the more present you need to be; otherwise, you will be forced to relive the past again and again.""""If you can be absolutely comfortable with not knowing who you are, then what's left is who you are.""""The more limited, the more narrowly egoic the view of yourself, the more you will focus and react to the egoic limitations of others.

I assumed with the tenacity that Oprah is pushing this book it would be so great. Also, the title ""A New Earth"" has such a lovely ring to it, a title filled with hope and promise. That is what I thought, but I was so wrong. Please, please, please don't waste your time, money, or energy on this false and misleading teaching.As a small disclaimer, I never in my life thought I might write a review that would cause others to perceive me as ""one of those crazy Christians,"" but that might happen now. Please bear with me and hear me out.I started to have unsettled feelings toward this book immediately upon reading it. However, I told myself, ""Give it more time."" Even though I am very secure in my beliefs and faith, I am a life-long student to personal growth and do have a very open mind. I love learning new things and new perspectives, but this book actually started to make me feel physically ill. I mean truly nausiated, which has never happened before though reading. I have to admit that I wasn't able to finish it.In what I read, Tolle's position is that God isn't a real being, but rather a state of consciousness that we are all a part of. Consequently, everyone is God. He wants readers to believe that any belief system regarding anything is okay as long as it makes the individual feel good. He quotes Christ completely out of context and does the thing where he says, ""Christ said ..., but what he meant was ..."" What concerns me most is how many people will be led in the opposite direction of real truth because of the hype and Oprah's emphatic endorsement.A fellow reviewer says: ""Max Lucado (he is senior pastor at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio) did a sermon just this last weekend, April 20, 2008, about false teachers. Here are a few excerpts: ""Take heed that no one deceives you. Many will come deceiving and many will be deceived. You've probably noticed that churches are Petri dishes for self-serving egomaniacs who masquerade as ministers of the Gospel [and other non-Gospel teachings]. They boast of insider information with 'God led me to say to you' and 'Heaven [or the Universe] had told me to say.' They position themselves as religious gurus, code breakers, or members of an inner circle [as per Gnosticism]."" Lucado then described a man in Puerto Rico who claims to be Christ incarnate as well as this book, Oprah and Eckhard Tolle's A New Earth, and continued with, ""Don't be enamored by large crowds, great television productions, good looks. Stick stubbornly to the question: are these people pointing people to Jesus [as a role model] or pointing people to themselves. If they're pointing people to themselves, get out while you still can!""This is so true, especially here!There are people searching and searching for truth and meaning to their lives. They have questions, and desires for more. They are trying to find answers and in this book Tolle actually promises that through the process of reading the book that the answers WILL come. Tolle paints a picture that Christ had some decent things to say, but that people didn't really understand what he meant and that the Christian movement was blown completely out of proportion and here we have an organized religion thousands of years later with no merit (because of course God isn't real, because he's God, and you're God, and we're all God with an unchecked ego). People are going to swallow this garbage like candy because it lets them feel good about believing in anything. I could also see how it would calm potential internal stuggles with questions like, ""Do I really need to know Jesus to go to heaven?"" or ""Should I be seeking God?"" Or people who are anti-Christian or anti-religion in generally (not just Christianity) because they've had horrible life experiences, or because so-called Christians gave them a terrible impression of God, Jesus-followers, Christians, religious peoples, and faith. Not to mention kind-hearted individuals who have never heard anything really of Christ and only know His name as a figure in ancient history.What I would love for people to know is that regardless of what you believe or what you've experienced, God loves you more than any person in this world ever could multiplied by a million. There is true acceptace and purpose through Christ. He desires intimacy with you above all else and in truly seeking Him, none of this other stuff really matters. There is true freedom though God, Christ, and the Spirit; freedom that Eckhart Tolle would like to believe he is experiencing but never will as long as he seeks his own glorification and the desire to be super-enlightened and highly intelligent.Many people, I'm sure Tolle included, see people of religious faith as weak. We just take life one punch after another and call it God's will. This is not true, and that perspective isn't freedom either. Freedom is knowing who God is and who he created you to be while growing and changing to embracing those truths. There is evil in the world that influences us and talks trash to our subconscious all day long. The Enemy is the great deceiver, the great mimicker who likes to make us feel guilty or inadequate, who tells us we'll never reach our potential, but builds us up and causes false delight when we're doing or saying something that fulfills our egos. Eckhart Tolle cannot lead you to any pearl of wisdom that will awaken your life purpose; all you need to do is ask God to reveal it to you. Just keeping asking until He does, and He will.Aside from all that, Tolle's writing style is a lot of fluff. Aside from the Christian persepective, it difficult to extract what all the words mean. It's not a writing style that is reader-friendly. It's like Tolle likes to hear himself ""sound"" intelligent on paper. You know the type.In all, save yourself the trouble and lies and don't buy into the hype, regardless of what Oprah says.",['Eckhart Tolle'],['Self-Help']

Now, I don't know what Oprah is on these days, but she has been making some embarrassing and ridiculous decisions of late, especially in endorsing the useless Dr. Phil (I cannot believe he still has work after that Britney Spears fiasco, of all things) or her tired 'Book Selections' (almost all of which have a troubled female character at the helm). Of late, she's been getting more preachy about spirituality and new-age living, and who wouldn't, if you have zillions in the bank and all the time in the world. I would love to build schools in Africa too, but I just don't have the cash for it.Meanwhile, her latest endorsement is for Eckhart Tolle, a somewhat sleazy (yes, sleazy) author who insists that he is 'enlightened' and 'fully conscious' at every single state or stage of life (he also insists that he is 'enlightened' during every waking moment, but then what about the times hes fast asleep? But I digress). Anyway, the entire book is pretty much a direct-to-video rip-off of the basic tenets of Buddhism. Now Buddhism, which is what I dabbled with when I was in my late teens, is a beautiful faith, but the beauty of it is that its' leader believed in renunciation and sacrifice, and did not state at every hour that he was 'enlightened' or 'had no ego'.Tolle is extremely egoistic. His massive ego, for one, comes to the fore at every single stage, simply because he is so obviously in love with himself and his 'enlightened soul' that its almost frightening. THIS is a spiritual work? Oprah, what are you on? How could you force-feed a nation such trite garbage? I would rather read the fictional works of Roger Zelazny than sit through this self-indulgent ode, because quite clearly, the message of this book is totally lost within the first twenty pages itself.Certain basic principles are true though - we need to move away from the 'I' and think of the 'Us', we need to creatively foster our souls through generosity, forgiveness, etc, but hey, we already knew all of this. The book promises to ""Awaken you to your life's purpose"", but instead seems like a count of the authors' highly selfish musings on life, while all the time reminding us that if we follow him, we will also become as 'enhanced' and 'spiritually awakened' as he.Heres the thing : A true leader or spiritual guru should NEVER claim to be 'fully enlightened' or 'in a state of higher consciousness all the time'. This is up to his followers to judge. If you don't believe in the entire guru-seeker system, then don't write such books. Tolle seems extremely vain and even somewhat desperate during the course of this book, and his 'handy hints' of 'moving up the spiritual ladder' are at best laughable.What is even more laughable, is that like the hideous ""The Secret"" from 2007, this will another massive seller due to the Oprah Effect. There are other, much better books, most notably by Deepak Chopra (who doesn't say ""I, I, I"" all the time) and his son Gotham Chopra. Or try reading the works of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and the ""Art of Living"" Course. Eckhart Tolle is a soulless being, a shell of a man, a corporate-backed marketing machine with no respect or concern for the upliftment of humanity. If you understand this, then you are ready to truly spiritually progress. Wake up!",['Eckhart Tolle'],['Self-Help']

Lewis states that our only connection to Eternity is now.(Perhaps Lewis got that from the Hndus and Budhists as well, or perhaps spritual teachers arrive at the same conclusion.) And, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to conclude that fear truly is the root of all evil. These same ideas of the ego (lower self) and being in the moment are espoused by Deepak Chopra. Another book that readers might find more accessible is the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.The ego-- cant' live with it; can't live without it. Since we exist on this plane where the ego is very much present, many of us need a more organized and concrete presentation to satisfy the ego so that we can actually bypass it and become conscious. When something is presented in such an esoteric way, many people who are becoming conscious may not be able to wrap their minds around it. That being said, there are many voices who reach different people. Many find something in this book that speaks to them and that is a good thing.

It tells people in this time how blacks were treated unreasonably and how you should treat everyone as and equal and work hard to get what you want to be a respected individual.

A story that should be read again and again. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the classic novel written in 1960 by Harper Lee to great critical acclaim, received the Pulitzer in 1961 and became a classic film in 1962 starring Gregory Peck as the hero Atticus Finch.We are in the life and times of 1930s Alabama, the town of Maycomb County, as seen through the eyes of a young tomboyish girl named Jean Louise Finch, or &quot;Scout&quot; as she is called by her widowed lawyer father Atticus and her older brother Jeremy &quot;Jem&quot; Finch.The span of the story takes place within three years of their lives. From their summer get-togethers with their young friend Dill from Meridian, Mississippi; to their adventures in trying to make their mysterious neighbor Arthur &quot;Boo&quot; Radley come outside; to the courtroom drama of black man Tom Robinson accused of raping a white woman by the name of Mayella Ewell.All characters are positively wonderful! There's the Finchs' black maid, Calpurnia, who acts like the children's mother and guardian; their colorful neighbors: Miss Maudie Atkinson, Miss Stephanie Crawford, and Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose; the town's sheriff Mr. Heck Tate, and the Ewells. All involved help move along the story with both poignancy and humor. The ending of the book, where Scout and Jem are saved by Boo Radley, is perhaps the sweetest moment in any book. The connection between the little girl and the mysterious man is heartbreaking!Harper Lee created a kind of hero to us in creating Atticus Finch, the strong, stalwart man who never hit his children, much less yell at them. Even when Jem and Scout would get into trouble, he would always be there with his broad shoulders and comforting arms. Gregory Peck, in the film, was the ideal choice for Atticus Finch, and won the Best Actor Oscar for it as well.My only complaint, and this is usually with all books and novels, is too much detail to the surroundings of the characters. There are moments when Miss Lee tends to fill about five pages with description of Alabama during the Great Depression. That, to me, tends to slow the story down. Even THE GODFATHER had that same problem, even though it too is a great book.All in all, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD lives up to its reputation as a very important and classic novel.",['Harper Lee'],['Drama']

B000NNOTXI,To Kill a Mocking Bird,,A15FMOLXDUCJC9,"""toijee""",8/12,4.0,1021161600,Lee's amazing writing style,"Nelle Harper Lee did a job well done when writing this book. To Kill a Mockingbird reminded me of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, describing the truths of humankind's hate and prejudice. Lee's novel was based on her own childhood past in southern Alambama in the 1930's. She put the aspects of prejudice, discrimination, stereotypes, and justice into an intelligent child's perspective. As most other child-point-of-view books, I found To Kill A Mockingbird more thought provoking than adventuresome. ""Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit `em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" A mockingbird sings its' heart out to make beautiful music, and never eat up gardens or nest in corncribs. That's why it's a sin to kill them. Lee used the symbolic mockingbird to depict the innocence of a few of the characters in the book. Such as Tom Robinson, a black man who never did a thing to harm anyone else, but was accused and charged of rape to a poor white woman because of his race. This book unmasks a county's feelings of prejudice and hate. The author incorporates a man defending to save a black man's life while teaching his children the unjust ways of the world. ""As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it - whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes form, that white man is trash."" Lee did a wonderful, unlike any other author, in making a book about the maturation of a child and the steps made into the real world.",['Harper Lee'],['Drama']
B000NNOTXI,To Kill a Mocking Bird,,A2SGXNEHBRJ472,Mr. Humble,0/0,3.0,1031875200,Book Review,"The story ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"" is basically a story about the way of life in a time of suspicion, hatred, poverty, and ignorance. It's about the effect of racism has on a small town from a child's point of view. The town is called Maycomb with ""grass that grows as tall as a person, roads of dirt, and children with none, sometimes or disgusting eating habits."" The main characters are Atticus, Boo Radly, Scout, Jim and Dill. I liked Boo Radly. He stayed hidden for many years. I don't know if he really did, what the town said he did; that he stabbed his father in the leg with scissors and then pulled it out. Boo placed wax dolls and food in the hollow tree and in exchange received candy from Scout, Jem, and Dill. Atticus the father of the children heads into a major problem as a lawyer defending Tom Robinson who is accused of assault and rape on a town woman. The children had many difficulties dealing with Ms. Doubtly's craziness from drug use. Seeing their dad being ridiculed by the town as he was trying to achieve justice for Tom Robinson also made their lives more complex.The characters I could relate to were Atticus, Scout, Boo Radly, and Dill. Boo Radly reminded me of events in my life when I was not wanted in places like school and church, Where Boo was stuck in a hole, I felt I was stuck somewhere as well. Just as Atticus stands up for human rights and believes in himself, I stand up for my rights as well as the rights of my friends. Dill is a character that has a wild imagination just like I find myself having a wide variety of ideas.My favorite part of the book is when Boo Radly saved Scout and Jem from Bob Edwell. As well, I thoroughly enjoyed the part where Bob Edwell is twisted crimes were exposed and he was killed accidentally.For the educational and symbolic idealism the book deserves a medal. The book exposes and illustrates hard reality in a time when people were racist. My least favorite part of the book was when Tom Robinson was killed because he was killed by hate. It was as if he was going to die anyway whether a public execution or not. From a student's point of view, I would change the use of the n word so readers don't have to see it.I would recommend this book to as an insight and perspective on history. The type of person who would like this book would be a person who enjoys reading history, a suspenseful novel, or a person who likes to read about problems in the past.",['Harper Lee'],['Drama']

B000NNOTXI,To Kill a Mocking Bird,,A1ARA52HB238HT,"Matthew M. Yau ""Voracious reader""",4/6,5.0,1143158400,Conscience is the one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule,"One of the most unforgettable stories of all time, To Kill A Mockingbird becomes a landmark novel in American literature since its publication in 1960. It is a novel of a lawyer, Atticus, in the deep south defending a black man Tom Robinson charged with the rape of a white girl. Nine-years-old Jean Louise Atticus, from whom her father always shelters and whom neighbors often deems too young to understand the racial struggle, narrates the story. She does it with a stark manner and equanimity of an adult who is savvy of the law. Her perspective is unbridled of the biased and disapproving voices of the town, of which nobody does even one thing to help Tom Robinson, let alone risking one's own life to defend a black man who in the secret courts of men's hearts have no case. That simply being a black yields a disadvantage in the jury's deliberation let alone a black man who is allegedly convicted of an act of felony against a white person. Tom Robinson is dead as the girl opens her mouth and rains charges on him.A child's narration cuts to the core of hypocrisy: some of the most religious people turn their blind eye to an innocent black man who in the absence of any corroborative evidence is indicted on a capital charge and is on the trial of his life. Jean Louise's voice of the narrative might be hesitant, dubious, and questioning, she packs the novel with intimate voice of conversation, of people living and sorting out their lives and the whole racial entangle. Atticus therefore bears a formidable task to not only defend Tom Robinson but also to rebuff, with a righteous indignation, the inveterate discrimination against the blacks. He thrives to protect the children from absorbing the human ugliness: Why can't people get along with each other? Who do people get out of their way to despise one another? What really scares me is such racial labeling still exists now but in a subtler manner that no longer makes people feel broken. In the recent Katrina news coverage, the media labeled a black woman who waded through the hip-deep water hurling supplies out of a store a looter. Racial labeling pervades people like babies born with basic instincts: it renders a stereotype that is culpable of perception that is laden with judgment.Atticus knows that Tom Robinson's case, though it is as simple as black and white that it should never have come to trial, is something that dives right into the essence of a man's conscience. Conscience is the one thing that does not abide by the majority rule. It transcends all racial difference and confronts the intimacy of one's heart. That is the reason he wishes his children to embrace some ""ugly things"" that are concomitant of his defending a black man - for all he does is to abide by his conscience and to come clear of it. It is never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name, especially when one is defending a good cause against mendacious testimony. It just shows how poor and piteous people are when they with maddening superiority thrive to label and call name at others.To Kill A Mockingbird vehemently condemns those who recklessly bend the law at the expense of the innocent's life for the satisfaction of one's supremacy. It also satirizes self-righteous people who rave madly when anything involving a black person occurs. Every page of the novel reminds us that the fight for equality is yet over: it radiates a wave of racial tension and menacing undertow of conflict.",['Harper Lee'],['Drama']

The people of the town are all white and the blackslive outside the town. The town is very small with not a lot of wealthy people.Theme: The theme To Kill a Mockingbird, is represented in the Character TomRobinson because Mockingbirds are innocent like Tom Robinson. In the townof all whites in the 1930's being black was almost a crime itself.Characters: Tom Robinson, Mr. Ewell, Dill, Scout, Jem, Atticus, Calpurnia,Nathan Radley and Boo Radley, and Miss.

I don't think so.What book the schools should teach about is the book The Color Of Water now there's a book that can teach you something. Unlike this dreadful book it doesn't teach anything except for that back then if you accuse a black man for even looking at a female they're going to get accused of rape. Ha great book people!

The cruelty and complexity of of the world breaks into the second half as the children witness the consequences of their father defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.The freedom of a child's mind to observe what IS without judgment or malice gives this story it's power.

The first time I tried to read it I had to put it down because I got really confused at the beginning. However, I tried it again later on and I realized what a good book I had put down. For me it was still a little confusing at the beginning because the setting and characters were being introduced. It was also kind of boring, and that's another reason I didn't continue it the first time. You have to keep reading though because it gets much better. The story is about a brother and sister, Jem and Scout (Jean Louise Finch), growing up in a small town with their dad, Atticus. Throughout the book, they experience a number of exciting adventures. At the beginning, the story focuses on a neighbor down the street who appears to be very strange and never comes out of his house. In other words, he's a recluse. Jem and Scout, along with another friend Dill, are very curious as to why this is. They do some exploring and investigating that might just have you biting your nails. As the book moves on, it only makes you want to read more. Atticus is a lawyer and is involved with a very important case that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's really interesting and gives you a chance to make predictions to yourself on who should win the case. In a way, it gets you into the book and creates suspense that makes it exciting. Towards the end, there is an unusual twist that involves a Halloween party, a ham costume, and a walk through a very dark field at night.

B000NNOTXI,To Kill a Mocking Bird,,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,Diane L. Mechlinski,2/3,4.0,1310688000,Classic and Captivating Read,"Writing a review of this classic book and trying to find something to say about it that hasn't already been said many times before might not be the easiest of tasks. However, I felt that I needed to mention one thing about this highly-acclaimed and truly wonderful writing that may not have yet been addressed. Reading this book now, as an adult, it hit me almost immediately that its narration, done by Scout (Jean Louise), one of the main characters, who at the time of the story is seven-years old and by the story's conclusion, she is 10, yet she speaks within this book as though she's an adult. The story's intent was to be told through the eyes of a child - and with just a few exceptions, like when Scout finds herself in court when her father, Atticus, partakes in the trial of a young black man accused of raping a white girl, or addresses that she doesn't really understand what 'rape' is ... she is narrating through the entire book in terminology like that of an adult, and a very intelligent and thought-out conversational one at that. I found that to be hard to believe.Don't get me wrong - the story is amazing, written in such a way that one feels what they feel and sees what they see, experiences what they experience - very realistically written as well as emotionally and psychologically understanding. However, such a little girl as Scout is, it is highly unlikely that a child that young would really be able to explain law and life in such an adult manner as this little girl's narration presents. Otherwise, the book is magnificent and I highly recommend anyone who hasn't read it, to read it.As a writer, I've always been taught that if one is writing narration by supposedly a child, or an old person, one of a different ethnicity, or whichever way the story is to flow, then one must write the character's narrative in such a way that befits that kind of person so the story is realistic. I realize that this book is an ""adult story"" seen through the eyes of a child - therefore, much of her narration language/interaction thoughts, etc. with the other characters of the book should also be in a more child-like way. The story would be expressed that way, too. Perhaps more of the intenser explaining would have to be done in the dialogue of the adult characters, but a child is a child - they speak and think in their own way, also presenting a story through their own unique way.I have not seen the movie, but the book is a very powerful story of life in a quiet southern town that identify with the unfairness of those times, accusation of a crime judged wrongfully and how so many people's lives are affected and misdirected as a result. I do encourage both young and old to read it if you haven't already.",['Harper Lee'],['Drama']

A few reviewers worried that the book may be a little tough for children under fourteen to handle; ironically, this is a true testament to this book's enduring impact on American culture. It is too late to worry about really young children ""reading"" this story, because if they grew up in America watching the Saturday morning cartoons, they have already watched the movie version of OF MICE AND MEN several hundred times. That's right. Warner Brothers cartoons frequently paired a big, strong, dumb character with a little pipsqueek who comically controls him, slaps him around, or takes care of him. The little guy is ""the Boss."" They got that routine straight from Steinbeck's novel. If you want examples, the most recent one is probably Pinkie and the Brain, but they have done it for years with cats, dogs, wolves, and zoot-suited gangsters. The big ox-like one is almost always stumbling into and accidentally smacking the [heck] out of the little boss in his eagerness to pursue the prey, often Bugs Bunny. ""Which way did he go?

We can say too that our failures may be due to a state of mind or the wish to fill an endlessly yawning hole in the psyche. Inner loneliness often drives us in our several directions towards fulfillment. For drifters like George and Candy, it's a little piece of land that beckons; for Lennie, it's something soft and close---a dead mouse, a puppy, a piece of velvet. For Curley's wife, that ultimate destination was love, attention, and recognition; for Crooks, respect and justice. In OF MICE AND MEN, nobody gets what they want. The novel, like life, is an unmitigated tragedy and we are our own worst enemies.This is an American classic in the real sense of the word. Though Bob Dylan's verses may not be totally precise in summing up the story, they certainly sum up my mood after putting down OF MICE AND MEN.

B000NRBS2Y,Of Mice And Men,,A3BM3OVEA2POZS,"Tony C ""Tony C""",4/4,5.0,1039046400,An Easy Classic,"Aside from its stature as a classic of American literature and a masterwork of one of the 20th century's most significant writers, there is a reason why OF MICE AND MEN is an ubiquitous part of high school literature courses. This novella follows the structure of Fiction Writing 101 perfectly: Characters are introduced in broad strokes and allowed to fill in their personalities on their own. There is a completeness of scene, so much so that the story reads almost more like a play, with no action in any of the chapters taking place outside of the setting where the chapter began. (In one instance, the characters run off set, but the narrator leaves the reader's ""camera"" on an unpopulated stage while he describes voices and shouting outside.) Most of all, the story follows the perfect three-act structure so neatly that, in a 100-page copy, the characters are all introduced by about page 33, and the turning point happens almost precisely on page sixty-seven.But if the mechanics of Steinbeck's storytelling make this perfect for eighth grade teachers looking to fill out a lesson plan, it's his story that has put it high on the list of Books Everyone Should Read. All of the characters are given a fair chance to be sympathetic. (Only one, the violent, jealous, bullying Curley fails to accomplish that, but he fails on his own terms, not because the author needs a cardboard heavy.) The most memorable, however, is Lennie, the hulking, gentle-natured behemoth with the mind of a child, a victim swept along towards his tragic end by ironic twists of fate he could never possibly hope to understand.With characters this richly layered and one of the easiest storytelling styles Steinbeck would ever have, particularly in comparison to such later, more impressionistic masterpieces as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and EAST OF EDEN, it's not hard to see why OF MICE AND MEN is one of the rare examples of a novel written very much about its time that has nonetheless proven to be timeless.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

He is not a very intelligent person (everyone says he's stupid), and understands very little of what goes on around him. If it weren't for his friend George, who travels with him, Lennie would have a very difficult time functioning in society. In fact, he has that problem already. His strength is a danger to him, because sometimes he harms things without understanding what he's doing. For example, he's always crushing mice to death, and he even does this with a puppy. Lennie is innocent and would never intentionally harm anyone, but his stupidity and his strength are a very potentially harmful combination.This book raises an interesting question: what should be done with people who are dangerous through no fault of their own? Should people like Lennie, who unintentionally harm other people, be held responsible for what they do? Lennie is a very difficult case, because he does not deserve to be punished for what he inadvertently does, but he also cannot be left free to cause harm to other people. This is the central conflict of the novel.Set in depression-era America, this novel by John Steinbeck is well-written and thought-provoking. The dialogue is fabulous, as is the narrative.

George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in ""some trouble"". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble.This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant.George isn't the only example of ""human compassion"". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best.Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue.

Whatever joy most Americans grasped for seemed to be just beyond their collective reaches. In OF MICE AND MEN John Steinbeck portrays a people who are just as blighted as the land on which they trod. Lennie Small and George Milton are two migrants who are forced to wander the midwest in search of the American Dream, which, to them, meant a place of their own. Each recognizes that this dream will, in all likelihood, remain just that, an evanescent will-o-the-wisp that leaves them with little else but to talk about it. Many times in the novel, the huge but retarded Lennie asks George, a smallish but bright thinker, to rhapsodize about their future. To George, their American Dream is a place where no one can throw them out. To Lennie, it is a place where he can raise rabbits. And it is not only Lennie and George who reach out for the unobtainable. It is arguable that nearly everyone else has their own competing dreams, with the same chance of success as Lennie and George have--none at all. The ranch hands where Lennie and George find roustabout jobs are the hopeless in search of the unobtainable. Candy is a one-armed elderly worker who seeks security for his old age. Crooks is a proud black worker who searches for racial equality in an age that did not know the term. Curley is a nastily pugnacious man who spends most of the scenes in which he appears in a hopeless and helpless Holy Grail search for his wife who spends an equal amount of time staying out of his way. And then there is Curley's wife, who is so bereft of identity that Steinbeck chooses not even to give her a name. She wanders the book like a meandering Eve, seeking only to disrupt the ordered lives of the men around her. In her search for meaning to her life, she collides with a corresponding search by Lennie for meaning in his. When she places Lennie's unthinking paws on her hair and dress, Lennie panics and unthinkingly stifles her, setting off a chain of events that forces George to play with Lennie's dream of a rabbit warren as a tearfully tragic prelude to ending that dream. In OF MICE AND MEN, Steinbeck catches not only the gritty edginess of political and emotional instability that then was ripping apart the social fabric of a pre-World War II America, he was also telling a timeless tale that suggests that for dreams to transform to reality, those dreamers had better leave the world of dreams long enough to weigh the balance of cost versus benefit. For Lennie, for Curley's wife, the price was way too high.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

I never got around to reading it until the next year however, which i guess was better since, i like reading on my own accord, rather than for school. I'm a stubborn person like that. Its a short read, about 120 pages, i think. I thought since i had to buy the book, i might as well read it, i can get it in one sitting, and be done with it. With titles like ""east of eden"" and ""grapes of wrath"", i really didn't think i'd like it, i mean ""east of eden"" is in oprahs book club, and everything about oprah's show disgusts me. Before you judge me, on that statement on oprah, keep in mind i'm a 16 year old, a kid. But back to the point, i read the story.What really scared me about the book (before i read it) was that it is required reading for some american literature classes. And from my experiences, english classes, have done nothing but to scare people away from books, that all good books, are just complex masses of hard-to-get symbols, metaphors, imagery, blah blah blah.So thats what i went into the book expecting, to be confused the whole way through because of my inadequate reading skills. But since it was so short, i thought i'd survive at least. The first page and the half of the second page, was describing the landscape, which started to scare me. But once the characters were introduced, it was loads easier to get through. What caught me was that the dog character from looney tunes, the one that always gets fooled by the squirrel hes supposed to chase, sounded alot like lennie ""which way did he go, george? which way did he go?"", you should know what i mean.What i really liked about the book was how human it was, especially in a negative sense. Being somewhat of an misanthrope (not REALLY, but i'm not exactly the most optimistic person ever), i enjoyed steinbeck's crack on human nature. Lennie, being too small-minded to use his own judgement, of whats right or wrong, what'll help or harm, whats too much or too little, what to be scared of, what to do, relies on other people's wills, in a mother-son, father-son kind of way. But since, it is an grown man (a STRONG man), the problems of his dependence on others are much more serious (such as murder).Just read it, its only about 8 dollars, if you don't like it, then its not that much of a loss, but if you give it a chance, on your time, rather than because of a school assignment, you'll probably like it.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

B000NRBS2Y,Of Mice And Men,,A3RINLIDX74QLP,"Monika ""equestrienne_23""",2/2,5.0,1089849600,A timeless look at society and the nature of friendship.,"Deceptively short and simply written, John Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; actually offers any reader quite a lot to think about. The relationship between the two main characters highlights a number of issues relating to the themes of mental illness and friendship. The story takes place in Depression-era California. Lennie is a very large, strong man, but not too bright. He doesn't have a mean bone in his body, but because he fails to comprehend his own strength, he frequently does harm to others without meaning to. He loves to pet soft things, like mice and rabbits and puppies, and then becomes distraught when they die, not understanding that he has been too rough with them. Lennie's companion is the brains of the pair, a small man by the name of George. He fills the role of both caretaker and friend to Lennie, and does his best to keep him out of trouble, though he doesn't always succeed.The two men are traveling laborers, moving around as the availability of work dictates. To keep Lennie motivated and obedient, George pacifies him with stories of a future bright with luxury and free from worry. They'll buy a small farm, he tells his avid companion, and live off the fat of the land. They'll have their own crops and their own livestock, and go to shows whenever they feel like it. And if Lennie stays out of trouble, he can even have some rabbits of his own to take care of. Captivated by this vision, Lennie does his honest best to obey George and avoid doing anything that might jeopardize their dream. But his best just isn't good enough, and just when their plans look like they might actually be falling into place, Lennie makes the biggest bungle of all, leaving George with an extremely hard decision to make.One of the social problems Steinbeck seems to be commenting on here is the place of the mentally ill or impaired in society. What was their place at this point in time? Did they even have a place? This story makes it clear that there really weren't many avenues open to the mentally ill at the time. They could be institutionalized, but such places had little merit during the 1930s, when mental illness was not yet really understood. Patients were treated little, if at all, better than criminals. The other option would be for such people to try to get along in the outside world of &quot;normal&quot; people, as Lennie does. When Lennie's Aunt Clara dies, he is left with no family and so falls in with George, who becomes his new guardian. But the outside world is no more understanding of Lennie's handicaps than the doctors of the time, and provides countless pitfalls of its own.The other major theme of the story is friendship. What is true friendship? To what extent does one have responsibility to a friend, and what does this responsibility entail? This is something George must struggle with every day. He feels obligated to care for Lennie and help keep him out of trouble, though he clearly realizes that his own life would be far simpler if he were on his own. In the end, when Lennie commits the ultimate, irredeemable blunder, George must sort through this inner conflict to decide what is best for both of them. Should he continue to protect his companion, or should he save his own skin? And if he chooses to put Lennie's best interests first, what course of action would be the most just? The conclusion he arrives at is both intricately complex and, in another light, quite obviously simple at the same time.Aside from these two overriding themes, Steinbeck also gives us glimpses into other issues of the time, among them racism and labor conditions. On the farm where the bulk of the story takes place, one of the characters is a black stable hand. Nicknamed &quot;Crooks&quot; because of his crooked back, this man is estranged from the rest of the workers (all white). The only one who fails to comprehend why Crooks should be treated any differently than anyone else is Lennie, whose simple mind doesn't grasp the idea of racism. We also see what life was like for Depression-era vagrants, moving from place to place in search of work. The living conditions were not ideal (though those in this story are far from the worst imaginable), the food provided often lacked proper nourishment, and employers could treat their hired help in just about any way they pleased. After all, the laborers were lucky to find any paying work at all. Even if they didn't like the conditions, where else could they go?I'd definitely recommend this book to any reader. Though times have changed somewhat, the issues Steinbeck comments on are still very relevant today. The ideas presented in &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; are many and deep, and much time can (and should) be spent contemplating them, but the book remains very accessible. It is a very short story, and can easily be read in one day. The style of writing is simple and direct, while retaining detail and a startling depth of feeling. However, it is by no means a feel-good story, so don't read this one at a time when you're already down in the dumps. While the ending has a very nice sense of resolution, and one is left feeling that George made the best decision he could under the circumstances (or, at least, this is the feeling I was left with), it is still rather depressing.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']
B000NRBS2Y,Of Mice And Men,,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,Rocco Dormarunno,2/2,5.0,1092096000,Steinbeck's gift to the present,"The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. OF MICE AND MEN is arguably one of the best novels about the hardships of the poor during this time.Lennie and George, a pair of drifters, represent brain and braun, respectively. Caught in the whirlpool of economic collapse, the two go from job to job, taking work whenever and wherever they can find it. Along the way, and especially at the farm that is at the center of the book's action, the pair encounter violence, racism, ignorance, selfishness, and a host of other tragic qualities among the poor that are compelled to fight tooth and nail for survival. Steinbeck certainly is not blaming the poor; rather, he is saying that this is what men will resort to when denied good, decent work. And, ultimately, OF MICE AND MEN has given us a glimpse into this tragic time. A highly recommended book.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

B000NRBS2Y,Of Mice And Men,,A2H181C1JWXQCQ,"Jenny K.(Berlin, Germany)",0/1,3.0,1127952000,Jenny's review,"The novel'Of Mice and Men' by John steinbeck deals with the Great Depression. He uses the two protagonists George and Lennie to convey the poor fate of many Americans of those days. George and Lennie experience this beeing hands on a farm, which is mainly leaded by the cruel son of the boss, Curley.Hope of their dream to own a farm is the only thing that gives their rough life sense. But the hope dies at the point when George kills Lennie, consequently it seems that having a dream is unnecessary if the sourrounding circumstances are not accordingly. I do not agree with the message Steinbeck pointed out.In each beginning of a chapter the place of action is described in detail followed by a dialogue. This structure reminds me of a play, at first the stage direstions and then the play. I think it becomes boring after a time, especially because there happens too less action at different locations. Using dialogues is a clever way to encourage the reader's imagination.Besides I dislike steinbecks's view of women, which he imlpies by the only feminine character, Curley's wife. He portays a picture of a trouble making, cruel and nameless object. But probably I'm of this opinion because I'm a girl.Over all it is to say that the novel cannot be put in one category. Steinbeck has his own style to impress his intention. His message is not obvious but if you read between the lines and think about it, you will find it out and then you can decide whether you agree. So this is the message i found out: Is hope right even if the situation seems to be hopeless and is our fate already predicted? Questions that need to be thought over. Finally 'Of Mice and Men'is a book it is necessary to think about.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

He incoporates so many aspects it is hard to keep up, even though the book is just 107 pages long. Steinbeck developed the characters very well, but pay close attention to the little details.The two main characters in ""Of Mice and Men"" are George Milton and Lennie Small. George is a short guy, but compared to Lennie he is brilliant. George works hard and takes care of Lennie. On the other hand, Lennie is the opposite of his last name. Lennie is huge, but inarticulate. George and Lennie wander from farms throughout central California looking for blue collar, manual labor.I read this book twice, and the second time I read it, I underlined all passages containing phrases that concern light and dark. I suggest you do the same, and you will notice a side of the book you may not catch if you quickly skim this book.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

B000NRBS2Y,Of Mice And Men,,,,4/4,5.0,1174608000,A Great Life Lesson,"For George and Lennie, living during the Depression is hard. In the book Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, George and Lennie are two migrant workers in the South. George is small and smart, and Lennie is a large and limited man, who does not know his own strength. When they have trouble at their ranch, George and Lennie are forced to make a run for it and start new somewhere else. They always find hope in their dream of owning their own land one day and farming together. At the next ranch they begin to work and meet many interesting characters, including the flirtatious wife of one of the farmers. Then, Lennie finds himself in trouble, and the book comes to an unfortunate end...This book is a classic because it teaches you the value of companionship. Although George and Lennie have almost nothing, they do have each other. Just over 100 pages, this book is a quick read. It involves other characters, such as Candy and Curley, and does a great job of describing these men's personalities. I enjoyed this book very much, and I would recommend it to everyone because it teaches a great life lesson.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

It started with the discussion of Candy's aged dog. The book gave the impression that the dog's age made him no good to even himself, the ""quality of life"" argument that has been advanced to support euthanizing the elderly, weak and infirm.After discussing Candy's dog, the argument proceded to Candy himself, where he longs to be euthanized when he can no longer work.Finally, we come to George's murder of the retarded Lennie, which is completely justified by Slim, the voice of the one sympathetic character in the book. I believe that George was looking for an opportunity to divest himself of Lennie, and that opportunity presented itself when Lennie killed Curley's wife. It was also mentioned that if Lennie was institutionalized, it would be worse than death. I realized there are conflicting opinions about the moral nature of George, but I don't believe he was a good character.As I was writing this review, I recalled Proverbs 31:8-9 ""Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.""

A surprisingly interesting read, &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, there's one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality? You, just like our two &quot;heroes&quot;, will have to journey through the vast rivers and valleys of Salinas to find out! If you're just an average reader, like myself, you'll want to read &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot; at least twice, just to understand the subtle nuances and charm of the overall story. With so much to offer, this Steinbeck tale of yore is definitely a keeper!",,

John Steinbeck Author Of Mice and Men used this quote as an Allusion to his book where it foreshadows events that have yet to occur.According to the quote what it mean is you set yourself up to let yourself down. In the book Of Mice and Men two characters George and Lennie have a plan to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. Therefore both characters get a land job where their dreams just scrambles in a matter of weeks. Lennie actions led their dreams to be destroyed it was when they arrived to their new job and at the time one of the workers dog just had given birth to puppies. In which Lennie asked George permission to have one of the puppies and George said yes. Within a few weeks the dog died and was witness by the boss son's wife in which she was killed at the site. Seconds after the incident Lennie headed back to where George told him to go just in case he got into any trouble, which he did, at the end. As a result George headed to the site and killed Lennie before the men got a hold of him. In all both men are in screach of identity and in my point of view each character of this book are lonely in which they have trouble finding themselves. Overall this book shows great friendship amoung these two characters eventhough George gives Lennie a harsh treatment but it is the worst for the better. George shows how much he care for his other half and that he is willing to go all out for Lennie, he gudies him through for his own benefit. Incredible book as the Author uses great literary terms and expresses each and one of them.

I really enjoyed this book because the story had alot of detail and action in chapters. It wasnt like most books and drug on forever. This book had several big events happen per chapter which kept me interested in the story the whole time. The story first begins when George and Lennie are on the run from Weed because a woman accused Lennie of raping her. Lennie was accutally just feeling on her pretty red dress. They take a bus to a ranch where they are going to work but the bus driver drops them off way before the ranch. When they finally reach the ranch they meet tons of nice people and some people who arent very nice. They meet the boss's son Curly who does not like Lennie because he is so much bigger than him. Curly and george later on get in a fight and Curly does not win. This book was a very good book and i would recommend it to any high level reader.,,

This book is like comedy but also serious. I really enjoy the book characters George and Lennie. I like George because he looked out for Lennie because Lennie was a little slow and instead of making fun of Lennie like some kids do today he helped Lennie. I just loved Lennie because lennie was actually innocent it was jus that he didn't know what he was doing half the time. I was so happy that Curly got his hand crushed by Lennie because he deserved it. I am upset that Candy didn't kill his dog instead of letting Carlson do it. The end was very sad because Lennie didn't mean to kill Curly's wife but he didn't know his strength like George said and he accidentally killed her. When George killed Lennie i was upset and happy. I was up set because Lennie didn't mean to kill Curly's wife and Carlson and George knew that. I was happy because now he won't have no more trouble and he is peaceful now. So all together i really enjoyed the book Of Mice Of Men by John Steinbeck.,,

The Hobbit I just reread for at least the third time, and it is well-written. By the time one comes to The Return of The King, his prose is stilted, seeming to mimic Malory's Morte d'Arthur and deserve the same kind of criticism Mark Twain wrote regarding Fenimore Cooper. Also, if anyone notices these things, in The Fellowship Sauron seems unaware of the existence of the ring, and doesn't know whether Gollum or Bilbo have it, and can't find the Shire. By the time the Return of The King was written, Sauron's existence depended on the Ring and he vanished when it was destroyed. I am not quoting but Gandalf does not seem to think the Ring is essential at first to Sauron's power but would prove disastrous in his possession, while later to destroy it is to destroy Sauron. Also he seems to know where Frodo is at the last when Frodo dons it. This may seem subtle to some, but you can't actually have it both ways. It seems as though Tolkien changed his own ideas about the nature and power of the ring, but never went back and revised his text.Him they sent thither. Sore hard were their travails. And thus he spake... this Malory pastiche belongs in the 16th century, or in Dante Gabriel Rosseti, but not in the 20th. I am surprised so many are sucked in by it. Still, ""The Scouring of the Shire"" finds Tolkien back in his best story-telling mode and sections like this make for great reading.",['J. R. R. Tolkien'],['Juvenile Fiction']

Tolkien superbly writes this novel, weaving a fantasy universe that have wasted countless hours of my time on wikipedia. Although it was written in a more lighthearted manner than the Lord of the Ring Series, also by Tolkien, it does not lessen at all the fantastic storytelling of the book.In short, a hobbit (an imaginary creature that resembles people, just half their size), named Bilbo Baggins, is whisked away on an adventure, along with a band of courageous dwarves, and a wizard, in order to reclaim the dwarves lost treasure that was stolen by a dragon named Smaug.

I thought it was really fun to read about the insanity of war and what a person thinks of war. In my opinion war is crazy I would not want to be in a war for anything in the whole world. I could not imagine myself flying in an aircraft over a battle zone bombing things, and risking my life for my country many times. That is what the main character of the book did he was Yossarian. Yossarian was my favorite character in the book, because he understood how crazy the war was and he really didn't want to be in it. Many times he tried to get away from where he was stationed but the commanding officers would not let him leave. Yossarian made a lot of decisions throughout the book whether or not to leave the army or to stay, and he was always looking out for the most important person in his life and that was him. That related most to me, because I think of myself as the most important person in my life, and I would do whatever it took to make me happy. Not to say I wouldn't help other people, but I would look out for myself first and for most. I thought the book was very funny. The author Joseph Heller used very funny language throughout the book. His diction is what made the book so great. He made the readers see how insane war really is, which I think is really good for young people to figure out, before they get involved with the army or navy. Think how crazy you have to be to fly a jet over a place that is being bombed and try to dodge missles being fired at you. To me that would be insane and to Joseph Heller that would be insane also. I couldn't imagine myself ever wanting to go to war. People might say well your dying for your country and you have to do this to protect us, well there are other ways of solving disagreements with other countries. Every character in the book was very realistic. I thought that the soldiers were all very scared to die, and they wanted out. I wouldn't' blame them. Overall this book was really good, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that has the insanity of war in it, without the violence and the graphic descriptions. Some parts were confusing to me but for the most part I understood the whole book. I would read a Joseph Heller book again.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']
B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,AYZMJYCRIZWIO,"suetonius ""seutonius""",1/2,3.0,1013644800,War is Hell; War is Fun,"This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. I gave up early on and came back to it after reading one good review after another. The first few hundred pages can be confusing and even dull. Heller's disjointed out-of order story telling technique is very hard to come to grips with. There are some entertaining passages even at the beginning but you have to slog through many dimwitted puns. There are some scenes that are quite funny. The best, in my mind, is a scene near the end, where Yossarian is offered the chance to go home by the Colonels that have been tormenting him. There's only one catch, he has to agree to like them, to be their pal, and say good things about them. This is unacceptable and he chooses instead to run away. Skip the puerile chapter titled ""Major Major Major Major."" The one joke of this insult to the reader's intelligence is the character's name: Major Major Major and the rank he is automatically promoted to on joining the army.It gets better after the slow start and story begins to come together once you get halfway through. Yossarian, or Yo-Yo to his friends, is the unhappy and psychotic bombardier who is the central character of this non-story. He's afraid of dying and is upset that his superiors have repeatedly raised the number of combat missions he must fly before he can go home. His friends are killed while incompetent, evil people are promoted and prosper. The black-marketeers Ex-PFC Wintergreen and especially Milo Minderbinder get rich. He's haunted by the memory of a fellow flyer (Snowden) dying in his arms over Avignon.Whether you think this novel is a good or not, it exists and many people who have never read the book are familiar with the title phrase. Heller uses Yossarian's situation to makes some points about the absurdity of war and, perhaps, of modern life in a Capitalist society. He points out that you are ""free"" just as long as you never actually want to use any of your freedom. It's interesting to see a depiction of American soldiers during WWII who have absolutely no patriotic or heroic feelings but are only concerned with saving their skin or perhaps profiting from the situation they are in.

I imagine many people are that type of person. I am not.For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them. Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal. Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.Take General Peckem. It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone. Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all. In fact, I found him rather efficient.Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them. But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters. Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity. It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much. Also, there was a ridiculous overuse of a certain figure of speech (mostly used to describe Milo).On the good side, the book was quite funny, and the satire was amusing where it made sense to me.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy.Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all.Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way.For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel.One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar.It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.Timeless & flawless - you must read this book",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society. But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant. Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material.The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II. It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar. He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead. The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military. When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission. But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly. To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital. It is here that he is first introduced to ""Catch-22.""Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends. So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly. Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity. He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.) But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation.The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times. The character of the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel. None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from. The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America. Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous. Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country.Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war. It does well to hold the reader's attention. The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read. It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be. Pick it up; if you don't like the first two pages, then don't bother reading it, but if you do, you'll enjoy the rest of the book.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A21HDRSF48W174,Har Pikada,10/18,2.0,1186444800,Catch-11,"Just finished reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22.I did not like it. Here are my reasons. I have avoided citation of specific instances in support of a point so as not to give anything away.Heller works the novel like an Archilochus/Isaiah Berlin hedgehog - around the idea of people entrapped, enervated and then destroyed by intended and unintended contradictions of, in this case, the war machinery. Perhaps the indictment is of any powerful bureaucracy - even life itself. The irrational and dehumanizing aspects of war unfold in farcical iterations. Each iteration further fleshes out and reinforces the chimerical webs that entrap the flies - the harder they struggle against it.The author is most formidable in his use of the language. What skill it must take to overuse the language so incredibly, yet, so lightly. His pen shows no strain - none at all - as it moves left to right, up and down - over and over again - fluting out in steady drips a full mountain of descriptors. It would be achievement enough if the overlapping descriptors somehow came together harmlessly. But here the imagery is all the more better for it. As if, using the elements/techniques of oil painting, one has churned out a most exquisite set of watercolors! Gestures, expressions, movement of any kind rise from the medium of words to that of a resplendent image almost immediately. This, I propose, is Heller's true achievement.No doubt, Heller has several sources and inspirations. Certainly one of them is Dostoevsky, class Hedgehog. But Heller's one big idea is hardly novel. Literature has many memorably executed suffocating, paradoxical, tragicomic bureaucracies. Repetition of an idea is in itself not a critical drawback because new ideas are not so easy to come by. An existing idea newly represented such as to expand its scope and understanding can be just as worthy an achievement. But there too Heller falls short.Heller fails because his deliberate, repeating exaggerations become too repetitious. The iterative unfolding of the novel is thick with dialogs, events, characterizations that repeat far more than they move. After a point these repetitions do not add anything significant to any aspect of the novel. The plot is not any more intricate for it. The characters are not any more intelligent or coherent or paranoid for it. The repetitions cease to reinforce anything. In-fact they blunt any worthwhile movement that comes along. Such as ascension of Milo's enterprise into lunacy. The repetitions strip all the edge of such progressions.Since Heller himself makes several references to Crime and Punishment let us consider it. Too serious and intricate a comparison would be silly but one may still compare certain general aesthetics like plot and character richness. Look at the exquisite contemplative gallop with which Raskalnikov moves to crime and then towards punishment. Look at the coherence of his paranoia. Look at the rich characterizations of Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovitch.But yes, having said that, I think, Yossarian's stroll through war torn Rome is just as beautifully illustrated as any of Raskalnikov's stroll through Petersburg.All in all, I think the novel is worth reading for its language. Otherwise, I would put it after so many of those other outstanding classics.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']
B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A3DXV5YMDJE6EW,Tyler M.,3/5,2.0,1262131200,A disappointing book.,"I just finished reading this book, and it was definitely a chore. I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the ""Jokes"" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching ""Lost"" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities, but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

So, if you're a bit skiddish of vulgar language and references you'll be sorely disapointed in this book.The whole book is full of catch-22s. For instance, a character named Hungry Joe likes to take pictures of naked women that never develop correctly but when he was a citizen, he had been a professional photographer.This book jumps around a lot. It gives tidbits of information that at the time might not seem important but tie into the main story later.

B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A3G36QYR6PWME9,Timothy P. Stallcup,3/5,3.0,1292889600,Perhaps It Hasn't Aged Well,"I don't presume to add much to the varied and detailed reviews of the book, except perhaps for an observation on how a popular work esteemed by one generation simply may not transcend its own time.Like many, I first read Catch-22 many years ago in high school. I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the ""counter-culture"" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism. War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as ""absurd,"" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the ""syndicate"" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin. Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary. Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step. More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before. Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and 70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation. Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc. It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it). I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking. And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many ""popular"" or ""political"" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was. On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site. That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']
B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A3KTN5FAMUV36H,Flying Photographer,0/1,3.0,1335312000,A Catch for the beginner - why to read (or not) this novel,"While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the ""catch-22"" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.Now to the real meat, the content.If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be ""catched""!",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

There are entire paragraphs that you need to read again and again because they have a remarkable perspective about the human condition. But then you struggle to remember them 10 pages later because of the new ideas that Heller has raised. One technique that Heller has mastered to create this density (for all I know, he invented it) is absurdist statements: ""The Texas turned out to be good natured, generous and likeable. In three days, no one could stand him."" There are hundreds of these passages in the book.Heller also uses rare adjectives and adverbs throughout the text, often paired with a more familiar word. Again this adds to the density of the reading, even as you turn to an online dictionary for a definition.The book is also memorably grueseome and sexual, sometimes together. The bomber pilots lead a warped life, and so even their leisure is warped. They're whoring and cheating as much as possible, usually out in the open because they simply don't live in a just society any more. As an old, starving Italian woman explains to Yossarian near the end of the book, when he asks her why Military Police destroyed her whorehouse: ""Catch 22 says they have a right to do anything that we can't stop them from doing.""Just when you think you're going to like someone or that the book is going to be fun, Heller slams you with a wounded or dead pilot or a child prostitute. It never stops.Basically, you become like Yossarian, the protagonist, in that you want to just scream at the top of your lungs that everyone and everything is crazy, and that we need a new crop of adults to come in and change the situation. Yet, because it's war and human nature, it will never happen.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']
B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A2I6RN76IIIV34,Mark R,1/1,5.0,1348790400,Comedy in War,"Creating comedy during the murderous insanity of World War 2 is nothing short of pure genius. Joseph Heller, author of the fictional masterpiece Catch-22 showed the world a different view of the perils encountered during war, twisting them into a witty page turner. The story's main character, United States Air Force Captain John Yossarian, is a B-25 bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, west of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea in the year 1943. Understandably, Yossarian continuously tries to scheme his way out of flying bombing missions, since thousands of people he has not met are trying to kill him. Despite his best efforts, Colonel Cathcart continues to increase the amount of missions the men must fly to satisfy their service requirements and return home. As the title suggests, there is a catch:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause in Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. ""That's some catch, that Catch-22"" he observed. (p.46)The above quote is one basic yet confusing catch can be put into simpler terms: a person is considered insane if he willingly flies combat missions, but if he requests to be removed from flying, he is deemed sane and therefore fit to fly. This basic element continually puts Yossarian in danger by the very system he is supposed to be protecting. He is more concerned with his own survival instead of winning the war, calling into question his integrity and patriotism.Heller follows no traditional structure in his novel, rather relies on free association to tie the book together. While the storyline seems at times to follow no discernible path, it perfectly echoes war is itself. Both are vain, chaotic and irrational. But it is that very structure (or lack thereof) that sets the book apart from anything else ever written. Having this book follow any sort of chronological order normally found in other novels would do Catch-22 (1961) a disservice and detract from its overall greatness. Heller implants key flashbacks and side stories at critical points during Yossarian's journey to save his own hide. The complicated storyline structure requires the reader's careful attention to accurately understand all descriptions and anecdotes. Heller introduces complex characters and themes early on, but waits until further in the text requiring the reader to rely on both recollection and foreshadowing.The book also uses third person omniscient narration to further develop and complicate the storyline. The reader learns more from each character than they would if the book was only through Yossarian's eyes. These different points of view allow the reader to fully grasp inside jokes and see characters in a complete three dimensional light. Few characters, due to the in depth detail in which they are described, are considered minor character.Catch-22 (1961) is a classic masterpiece that has withstood the test of time by being in a category all on its own. Pulling out all the stops, it grasps the reader and leaves you yearning for more. The book's influence on American culture culminated on the phrase ""catch 22"" becoming popular in the English language for a situation with idiotic circular logic further testifying to Heller's brilliance.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

Last week I finally picked it up, and what I thought would be the standard war story was anything but.Centering around Yossarian, the bombardier afraid of dying, the novel circles through events, showing them from different characters' perspectives at different times.

It is a strike at the idiocy of bureaucracy gone mad;it is a telling commentary on the frailty of man trying to live by the standards of decency and humanity he was brought up with, under the madness of war.Catch 22 is also an outstanding piece of entertainment. The first hundred pages or so have been described by minds greater than mine as '... Hysterical farce...' and more than once I had to put the book aside in order to wipe the tears (of laughter) from the corners of my eyes. Chapter three - subtitled &#34;HAVERMEYER&#34; is the first highlight of the book and I was in stitches several times as I read, and tried to read, and make sense of the glorious text found within. The writing style is unique. The book itself is easy to read. It has a straightforward plot (was there a plot?) which kept the pages turning but it did not take long for Heller to remind you are reading a book about war, and that war is dangerous, and people whom we love, people whom we are destined to love but never will, are bound to die fighting for the causes that we all hold dear. And some chapters you can hold up high for the joy and merriment they bring, the next chapter is just as likely to bring you back down to earth with a jolt, as one of Yo-Yo's friends go missing, and are presumed dead, or meets a particularly gruesome death in a way that no one could have predicted. But as each one dies, there is no way that it can be said that they died without every single shred of their character still intact.Catch 22 is hysterically funny, and at times, incredibly sad. It is a tribute to the strength and power of the human spirit, and as such is worthy of the five stars that I hereby give it. It is a classic novel, a book for the ages. Catch 22 is timeless. I think I need to read it again. Now.Greggles (LR)",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']
B000NWUHR6,Catch-22,,A2T1K151YNT2RS,Gary Brooks,1/1,5.0,1355356800,Worth reading twice,"Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is a novel unlike any other. It makes the reader think, it makes the reader laugh, and when it is all said and done Catch-22 gives the reader a great World War II novel that is told through some of the most unlikely soldiers.One of the main attractions to the novel is its comical tone. Comedy is found all throughout the book ranging from Yossarian's unorthodox ways of getting himself out combat duty to Nately's struggles to make a prostitute love him. Also the story is told in a unique circular way which constantly parallels the overall theme of explaining the purpose of what ""Catch-22"" means.If there is a fault in the book it is the slow development of the story. The chapters only give the reader a small taste of what the overall story is about and the storyline doesn't start forming until about halfway through the book. While this might deter some readers it can also create an incentive for the others to continue on and finish the story. Heller in a way makes his novel a puzzle that doesn't become completed until the very last chapter. The chapters in his novel could probably be read in any order (with the exception of the last chapter) and still make as much sense as if it was read the way it is printed.Catch-22 is a truly unique novel that will appeal to any reader as well as those interested in World War II literature. While the slow and confusing development of the story is its only glaring let down is also has an appeal that almost forces the reader to continue on with the novel so that all the confusion and loose ends can be cleared away by the time the last chapter is finished. The comical scenes as well as the ingenious elaboration behind the meaning of ""Catch-22"" and how it applies throughout the novel will entertain readers for years and years. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 will remain on book shelves for years to come and is a literary work of art that shall never be overlooked.",['Joseph Heller'],['Fiction']

You learn gobs of authoritatively detailed things about modern spycraft and high command and the toys of a year-2000 war, and you get to have a good time learning them.Like most of Clancy's books, this one has a bunch of plotlines and viewpoints -- a CIA agent in Beijing, a police detective in Moscow, President Jack Ryan in the White House, a Russian general in Siberia. But all the plots hang together nicely. And the crisis is easier to swallow than the ones Clancy used in Executive Orders or Debt of Honor. His characters are more real, too. They don't even preach at the reader as much. Clancy's just become a better writer. (Am I allowed to say that?)Clancy finds a clever way to stage a major war in a world where the USA is too big for anyone to plausibly take on: it's not the United States' war, but Russia and China's. The USA comes in as an ally on one side, but it's a long trip to get United States firepower to northeast Asia... Even so the actual warfare is just the last third of the book. This is as much a spy novel as a war novel.Fortunately it's a good spy novel. There's lots of fun, interesting stuff about intelligence work from several angles, from the White House to the secret agent to the Moscow cop, as the Russia-China crisis escalates and the USA tries frantically to track it.The war novel in this book isn't quite as neat as the spy novel. Clancy does a great job bringing across the human side of things: what it feels like to be a recon group lurking just in front of an enemy division, or a commando team going after a nuclear silo. There's an eerie mixture of skill and luck and personality and the other guy's mistakes that makes up a combat operation, and Clancy captures it all. Clancy also shows off neat tactics, like how to jury-rig a nuclear missile defense, or how to turn an unmanned drone and the Internet into the ultimate propaganda weapon.But I was hoping for more than that. The bad guys in this book try a basically straightforward war, and when the American toys come into that war the bad guys get crushed. This is fun to read. But it isn't much of a surprise. Since 1860 if not earlier it's been suicidal to have a straight fight with someone who has thirty years' technological edge. How would a smart adversary adapt against American forces? What's the year-2000 equivalent of Afghanistani tactics against the Soviet Union or the North Vietnamese tactics against the USA? This book doesn't have to figure it out, because it cheats a little: it assumes the bad guys are dumb.So this is no Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising. Clancy's gift in this book is in the details, not the big picture. But it's fun and you learn a lot. How much more do we ask of a book?",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

Tom Wolfe's &quot;A Man in Full&quot; comes to mind, with its vivid characterizations, its keen sense of setting, its complex and fun buildup -- and its relatively disappointing ending that's just too quick and too easy.Clancy's latest outing shares this fault, and has a couple of others. He reuses metaphors in a really distracting way, such as when, twice in 150 pages, he tells us a particular Navy-owned computer was &quot;the flower of 1975 technology&quot; but that it doesn't perform nearly as well as a modern iMac.Despite these faults, it's a compelling read, and fans will devour its 1,028 pages in a few days. The military detail is awe-inspiring, the social commentary is relevant (although sometimes you're not quite sure when his characters are reflecting on actual history or the U.S. history in Clancy's own parallel universe), and the action is first-rate. &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot; is set seven months or so after the action in &quot;Rainbow Six.&quot; It's a pity we don't get Clancy's epic installments that often.",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

B000NXBJF4,The Bear and the Dragon,,A1Q0UFY6YKH3V,Jon Eric Davidson,1/3,4.0,968457600,A notch down from Clancy's best...but still entertaining,"I, like many of the reviewers who have already submitted their thoughts, am a huge Tom Clancy fan. Well, let me clarify: I am a big fan of his nonfiction and his Jack Ryan novels - not of the franchised &quot;OpCenter&quot;/&quot;NetForce&quot;/et al. that he doesn't write but sticks his name on. So, I was one of the throngs eagerly anticipating &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot;.Mr. Clancy's typical pattern in the Ryan and Ryan-related novels is to build a wide-scale story, then blend it all together bit by bit into a dramatic and fast-moving finale. The style is no different here. He has an extraordinary knack for being able to write what seem to be unrelated &quot;side stories&quot; in the course of the general plot that wind up relating somehow to the broader picture at a later date. He is, for better or worse (depending on your viewpoint), on his game in this latest installment.Also, with most of his novels, the pace seems slow at the outset, then shifts to breakneck speed in the last 200-300 pages. In some respects, that was also done here, with a couple exceptions. I found the first 100+ pages to be a very fast read. Then it slowed down for another 100 or 150 before picking back up for a similar amount of pages, until finally hitting that last 200 pages blitzkrieg.Like some who have reviewed already, I was both surprised and a little put off by the dramatic increase in the sexually-related subplots, innunendo, and references. This seemed totally out-of-character for Mr. Clancy, moreso because instead of a small dose of it we got near-overload measures that popped up all the way to the last sentence of the book. Initially, in regards to the spy subplot, it was okay, but it just escalated to the point of being far too much and also unnecessary.The conclusion also seemed a bit rushed, and, unlike his previous novels, didn't seem to leave much &quot;open&quot; for the next Ryan adventure. It is an interesting parallel, then, to have Mr. Clancy describe Ryan as drained and not knowing what his next decision is while at the same time rushing to a rather awkward conclusion that wasn't entirely satisfying.I have never had a problem with the length of Mr. Clancy's novels, for the simple reason that they are great &quot;escapist&quot; works that you can savor for longer than a couple of days. So, I was initially not bothered by the 1000+ pages. But, I would submit that if he had cut out the numerous sexual references (as mentioned above), some of the tedious China-U.S. diplomatic meeting scenes, expanded the climatic battle, and fleshed out the conclusion more, the 1000 pages would have been of better overall value.If there is one wish for the next Jack Ryan novel, it is that is is a real barn-burner. And the first step towards that, in my opinion, is for Mr. Clancy to pay heed to the reviews from his die-hard fans (like myself). Otherwise, he does run the risk of falling towards the path of mediocrity. Some previous reviews have put him there already; I disagree. &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot; is, overall, a fun read. It has a good storyline, a great batch of characters, and did entertain. For that reason, criticism aside, I do rate it &quot;4&quot; stars. It is not Mr. Clancy's best work (&quot;Hunt For Red October&quot;, &quot;Cardinal Of The Kremlin&quot;, and &quot;Clear And Present Danger&quot;), but at the same time is not anywhere close to his worst. That inglorious title is still jointly held by &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Sum Of All Fears&quot;.",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

Yes, it was long, very long, but I thought that the highly-involving story and interesting characters made up for the somewhat slow pace of the novel (that has been complained about below ad nauseum). I disliked the writer's strong moral bias towards America and against the Chinese, and the way that everything runs perfectly for the Americans (&quot;the underdogs&quot;) while the Chinese stumble at every opportunity. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the relationships between the characters as well as the unusual scenario that is presented by Clancy as having the potential to cause a nuclear war.",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

Henderson,2/3,3.0,986428800,Most prolific use of the &quot;F-word&quot; since Blair Witch Project,"I've read every Clancy novel - usually getting it for Christmas and reading it before New Years. This one I started at Christmas and put down a while and didn't finish until April. Does that say something about how it held my attention or just turned me off? Maybe.China has depleted all of its cash reserves and their bargaining with the US to gain favored nation status is not going well when a televised tragic incident in Beijing involving the Chinese police, the Vatican ambassador and an American-educated Chinese Baptist pastor brings the negotiations to a sudden end. Meanwhile, Russia discovers a rich deposit of oil and gold in Siberia, not far from the Chinese border. What are the Chinese to do?It is typical Clancy. It is a well-researched technopolitical thriller with cliche character development, but many interweaving subplots. Throughout the series, we have watched, rather incredulously, the meteoric rise of Jack Ryan from history professor to the reluctant President of the United States. Now we watch great hordes saved by incredible luck. Don't get me wrong - I like the stories. As far as Clancy books go, I'll rate this one somewhere in the middle.The thing that completely turned me off, though, was the sex and language that contributed nothing to the story. It seems that Clancy sprinkled the book with profanity just for the sake of inserting profanity, and did similarly with the awkwardly-written sex scenes. Clancy should stick to writing about political exchange and weapons systems.So the story was good, but the sex and language took away from my being able to enjoy this book, so this will probably be the last Clancy book that I read.",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

I read this during the flap over the EP-3 surveillance plane that landed in Hainan and found that the China of &quot;The Bear and The Dragon&quot; was all too similar to the one in the news, with cynical, propaganda-peddling Maoist leaders trying to reconcile their failed ideology to the realities of an emerging capitalist state. Ryan is superb as the refreshingly politically-incorrect Leader of the Free World, and the book offers an enlightening take on high stakes diplomacy.

I was a little unsure about reading it because of all the negative reviews that I have read. I am glad that my interest in President Jack Ryan was greater than my doubts. I finished this book in about eight days. This is not for the weak of heart it contains over a thousand pages.What I didn't like. I was disappointed that the novel jumps ahead to where Jack Ryan is reelected President. I would have liked to read about that process and him having an opponent. Clancy could have talked about campaign reform and all that good stuff but it didn't happen. Clancy gives you the flashback highlights about how Jack got reelected. The only other thing that I didn't like about this book was that Ryan called the Chinese &quot;Klingons&quot; about 80 times. The first time was funny but come on come up with a different term.What I did like. This novel is a good continuation of Executive Orders and I feel it is a better book. Why? One thing there isn't 100 pages of technical blow by blow combat that really has no bearing on the rest of the characters. The assasination attempt on Golovko chairman of the Russian SVR was a good plot. It progressed well and it had an interesting development of FBI agent Mike Reilly. The Chinese angle was tremendous and interesting and showed how cultural differences between two nations can be a major problem in understanding each other. I felt Clancy explored and explained this very well. I also liked that there were opposing viewpoints within the Chinese government. I felt that this made this book very realistic and not comic bookish. Clancy also gives plenty of historical, cultural and detailed background information.What maybe important to you. If you don't like sex scenes in your novels you maybe a little offending by this book. I think it contains about 3 sexual explicit scenes which in my opinion could have been deleted but they also did prove a point. If you are on the ultimate polical correct nature you will be offended by the use of racial slurs toward Asian people. Their is more vulgar language in this book than in Executive Orders but it is reasonable placed. All in all this is a fantastic book. If you like Executive Orders I believe you will like the Bear and the Dragon. It is a faster pace book. This book is a little lower on the Jack Ryan end so if you want to read a lot about Jack it is not in here. The conclusion I felt was better than Executive Orders and Rainbow Six. Not that I liked or disliked the conclusion but I felt that Clancy did not rush the ending like he did on his previous two novels. It is a little preachy on Clancy's views but hey it is his book to write anyway he chooses. This is a work of fiction and I think that people tend to loose sight of that when they read Clancy's books because they are so believeable.",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']
B000NXBJF4,The Bear and the Dragon,,AXZK6FT8RIBEB,"The Geocacher ""finals""",2/3,1.0,994896000,Sorry Mr. Clancy,"The Bear and the Dragon has as usual in Clancy books, a huge gallery of people, a somewhat intricate plot and countless lessons in US politics, US economics and howto's and hownotto's in running large nations. What was well written and part of the plot in ""Debt of Honour"", now feels utterly boring and book-wise landfill.I've read every single novel Clancy ever wrote, and for every one, the underlying message just gets clearer; Americans are pure, christian, moral, fair and competent. All other nations and/or cultures are perverse, corrupt, lazy and outright stupid. So, when something really Bad happens because of the Other Guys stupitidy/laziness, Uncle Sam sends some of his Competent Moral People to save their sorry butts. And when battle erupts, only the Other Guys die. Repeat until fade.What's with Tom Clancy and smoking/se*/alcohol anyway? As a European I cannot for the life of me understand why he even bothers writing about it like it was sensational. I smoke and drink and have se* all the time - it's not what I want to read about in a book like this.The persons in the book are unusually one-dimensional, even for Clancy. Robby Jackson's father Hosiah and General Bondarenko are the only characters with a minimum of spark. All the others fail to stand out and just vanishes into nothing as soon as you turn the page. Too bad, because Clancy have done this better before.The technical research used to be Clancys hallmark, but even here he manages to disappoint me. The Red Baron did NOT fly around in a Fokker Trimotor! The trojan horse in Mings computer also confused me. I don't think it would have worked as easy as that. They have firewalls even in China.All in all this was a disappointing book, partly because Clancy doesn't seem to decide whether he has a parallell universe to toy with, or a could-be future of the world at hand. For example, he makes a couple of references to the Clinton/Lewinsky affair, but I cannot see where Clinton fits into the timeline of the Jack Ryan books. There are no twists to this book whatsoever, no cliffhangers at all. Even the ICBM at the end of the book is predictable....",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

In some of his earlier books, Clancy did show that he could construct a fast-moving plot, and turn out entertainment, if not art. But at this point in his career, he can't even do that.

B000NXBJF4,The Bear and the Dragon,,,,2/3,1.0,1003276800,Most Disappointing &quot;Effort&quot; by Tom Clancy,"As a Jack Ryan-novel fan and a conservative, I must say Mr. Clancy has done more to advance liberal and protectionist causes in this latest trash novel. The first third of the book is little more than personal propaganda, which while I agree with much of (except his insance protectionist stance), has no place in this popular entertainment. It just didn't add much to the story line (except for the late term abortion segment in China which was topical AND contributed to the story). Much of it was simply silly trivia - - why did he have to waste several pages describing the President's visit to the dentist?I also found his use of vulgarities and racial epithets highly offensive. No doubt liberals will soon be able to brand Mr. Clancy - - with some justification a racist - - a racist. He could have advanced his story line - - and maintained who his villains were - - with none of the inflammatory language he uses, and which he hadn't used extensively in prior novels. I suppose Mr. Clancy forgets that many patriotic &quot;slanted eyed&quot; &quot;Chinks&quot; live and work in America as citizens, and it didn't occur to him some might be offended.Finally, it was an exceedingly poorly written work. As side entertainment I finally began counting the number of obvious mistakes that made their way into the paperback version (I refuse to pay full price for hard-cover any more), including:p. 135 &quot;They could do anything with computers these days--make Rosie O'Donnell into Triggy, or Cindy Crawford obsolete.&quot; Clearly Clancy meant &quot;obese&quot;, not &quot;obsolete&quot;.p. 196 'Winston grunted &quot;Not hardly&quot;.' The use of double negatives shows up a LOT in the recent novels, and grates me no end. These are supposed to be the educated brass of American leadership, frequently employing double-negatives? It makes them appear to be doofuses. Ryan uses &quot;not hardly&quot; on p. 474, Robby Jackson says &quot;I've never seen nothing like this before&quot; on p. 575, and on p. 1050 Jackson says &quot;you just can't hardly lose this way&quot;. Maybe Clancy really is illiterate.P. 430 '&quot;How do we expect them to react?&quot; one of Rutledges underlings asked, sparing his boss the necessity of asking the obvious and fairly dumb question. The answer was equally dumb &quot;Your guess is as good as mine.&quot;' Later in the same scene, ON THE SAME PAGE, Clancy contradicts this exchange: '&quot;How will the Chinese react?&quot;, Rutledge asked Hitch. &quot;Not sure, Cliff, but I doubt we'll like it.&quot; These mistakes are REALLY irritating.p. 680 '&quot;Is this for real?&quot; The DC asked?' Clancy means the &quot;DCI&quot;. &quot;Director of Central&quot; or &quot;DC&quot; doesn't mean anything.p. 691 '&quot;What's the big deal&quot;, Jack asked.

B000NXBJF4,The Bear and the Dragon,,A3HLJQCY6GKRVK,"F. G. Hamer ""MadManxMan""",0/0,4.0,1014422400,"Close, but not quite","While Tom Clancy's fascination for military technology led to his creation of the ""techno-thriller"", with each new book he also expanded the personalities and politics in his make-believe reality. Unfortunately, The Bear and the Dragon seems to lose its way by comparison to his earlier novels, like Red October or Patriot Games. Though the story runs along at a good pace, it suffers from repeated scene changes between Washington, Moscow, and Beijing, with a dateline that can disorientate. It is rendered even more difficult by the inclusion of enough characters-with-long-names-that-you-can't-pronounce to fill Carnegie Hall, an overload of acronyms, and minimal character development.Having said all that, Clancy's hallmarks are his ability to blend realism and authenticity with intricate plotting and razor-sharp suspense. The Bear and The Dragon achieves what it sets out to do. As usual, the plot is way over the top, with subplots erupting like weeping carbuncles all over the place, and strange characters being unpleasant to each other every few pages. Even so, Clancy finds time to insert his usual non-too-subtle lessons on the vileness of Communism, the (unfair) intrusions of the press on presidential power, the sexual perversions of Mao (and anybody else who's not 110% American), the poor quality of Russian pistol silencers (and anything else that wasn's built in hometown America), the folly of cutting a man's throat with a knife (apparently they ""flop around and make noise"" when you do that), and other similar Clancy-like topics. It goes without saying that The Bear and The Dragon positively bristles with intriguing state-of-the-art military hardware. We're never quite sure how much of it really exists, or how much is in Clancy's imagination. In honesty, we don't really care, just as long as Tom Clancy goes on amusing us.Though The Bear and The Dragon is not Clancy at his best, it's still sufficiently Clancyesque, and in this genre there are few better authors. Maybe next time he will make a better job of hiding his right-wing xenophobia. We've always known it was there, but it's better when it doesn't jump out and smack you in the face... ouch!",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

It could have been less than 600 if Clancy had left out the political propaganda.The book's focus is anti-China rhetoric. President Jack Ryan's trusted advisers refer to the Chinese by many combinations of racial slurs and 12-letter or 10-letter curse words. All non-Christian Chinese characters are evil, (except one naive girl who likes sex), and Chinese-Americans, even those in the CIA and military, aren't trusted with sensitive information (and don't get a word of dialogue). The president's private discussions refer to Chinese as ""aliens"" or ""Klingons"". The president calls China's policy ""incomprehensible barbarism"" with ""incomprehensible stupidity"", and refers to the people themselves with curse words and ""barbarians"". President Ryan compares them to Nazis, visits Auschwitz, then promises to defeat the Chinese so it will never happen again. There's lots of actual preaching, including ten pages of evangelical sermon (broadcast by CNN) in the middle, and the pastors focus on the ""heathens"", ""godless pagans"", and ""Sons of Satan"" in China, how evil they are, how Mao was ""the voice of Satan"" and the ""mouthpiece of the fires of hell"" and how they love pretending they are gods. The main sermon ends with:""When Jesus looks into our hearts, will he see people who support the sons of Lucifer? Will Jesus see people who give them money to support the godless killers of the innocent? Will Jesus see people who support the new Hitler?""Anti-Communism statements are omnipresent. Dozens of characters monologue about how stupid and unworkable communism is and how only idiots could believe it. Even the thoughts of the Communist characters are depicted as stupid. In a book set in 2000, the focus on Mao's sex life is mind-boggling. Stories about Mao taking advantage of 12-year-old virgins are told on pages 52, 130, 168, 505, and 794.The book also focuses on China's one-child policy. The secretary for a top Chinese official tells a Japanese businessman that as a woman, ""I suppose I'm lucky to be alive"". The middle 200 pages is devoted to a couple who wants a second child after their first child dies, climaxing when doctors attempt a forced birth-abortion, a Vatican City cardinal and a Chinese Baptist stop him, and the police murder both, with the government supporting the police. Wait - a police officer murders an unarmed diplomat and a pastor in front of CNN cameras, and the government supports them? The next day Chinese police brutally beat 34 Chinese Christians, including the dead pastor's wife, on her own front lawn (again in front of CNN cameras). Clancy even suggests that the Chinese government might be harvesting the organs of aborted newborns and selling them on the black market.Besides constant rips on China, Mao, and everything Communist, there's lots of pro-capitalism. A big theme is China's unfair trade laws and how America deserves a level playing field (ignoring that we have unfair trade laws against most 3rd-world countries). There are speeches about why wealthy people are the smartest, the hardest working, and make the best government leaders. Jack Ryan is Clancy's consummate hero, and the book brags about his $80,000,000 bank account, million-dollar jewelry, and collection of fine furs. President Ryan also emphasizes that there is no such thing as ""class"" in America and everyone can have wealth if they work hard. He lauds the superior morality of Wall Street capitalists several times. At one point the ultra-rich SecTreas and former Wall Street tycoon declares that Wall Street would never purposely screw someone over, and expresses incredulity that America even does business with the Chinese. Copious displays of wealth - private jets, fine cigars, fine jewelry, fine art, fine clothing - are made by those smart, hard-working, and righteous enough to have earned them. Clancy attacks politicians for being greedy while mocking them for not making enough money by his standards.There's lots of other conservative propaganda. Roe v. Wade was a mistake and abortion is wrong. Government is evil and politicians are corrupt (except Ryan and his already-wealthy friends). More oil must be drilled and environmentalists are mocked. Clancy's adoration of violence is throughout. Our law enforcement should ""take justice into its own hands"". ""Real men"" have killed bad guys, or die with a gun in their hands. Pro-military rhetoric is constant, with all past and present US military actions described as ""liberation and never conquest"", even using Vietnam as an example. Clancy minimizes the significance of killing enemy soldiers, stating that they should have trained harder or not put the uniform on. Clancy says that the US military relies on massive bombing, rather than manpower, because we place a higher value on human life than other nations. Is Clancy unaware that our massive bombing campaigns kill far more civilians than our manpower-intensive infantry campaigns, or did he mean ""American life"" when he said ""human life""? After talking about how the Chinese were going to hell, a pastor comments that he loved comforting dying U.S. Marines because he ""knew they were going to see God"". A different pastor, getting full-on with the war effort (before the Chinese had even invaded anyone), states ""Let's give those Sons of Satan a reason to fear us"".There are typical anti-liberal attacks. The ""bad guy"" in the State Department is a close friend of the liberal ex-vice president. He is ripped on for going to Harvard. A Brown professor is a detached academic callous about human life, as opposed to the military personnel he's speaking to. There's a reference to ""fairyfied French food"", and rips on Europe. The American media, with ""lingering liberalism"", are said to not respect the public and have ""great solicitude for communist countries"". Feminists are mocked, of course, and homosexual and lesbian sex is derided as wrong.Speaking of that, genital size are frequently referenced. Chinese characters have small ones (literally and figuratively), while Americans have large ones. An American spy's ""sausage"" is referenced frequently by his Chinese lover and compared favorably to her former Chinese partners. Every Chinese male's sexual act is some form of perversion, but the Americans have ""boys must be boys"" sexual conquests. The use of Asian prostitutes by the American military is condoned as expected and acceptable by numerous characters. Though there are no Japanese characters (just one Japanese-American), the ""sexual perversions"" of the Japanese are referred to multiple times.As far as plot goes, it's one of Ryan's worst. From the beginning you know the Chinese will start a war with the Russians to get their gold and oil, and the Americans will help the Russians defeat them easily. You know the old hunter will shoot some Chinese, the spy will produce critical information, the Rainbow guys will run a mission in Russia, the missile-defense software will prevent a nuclear attack on Washington. I saw one surprising plot turn - at the last second President Ryan makes an idiotic decision, but in Clancy's world it's heroic. Every military engagement, every spy move, every government decision goes perfectly for the ""good guys"". Clancy is really sloppy with repetition. Over and over the same jokes are repeated, insults made, explanations detailed, wisdom given. We hear that one secretary gives her boss better oral sex than the other secretary at least 5 times from at least 4 different characters. Most of Clancy's old characters are recycled with no development except a new rank. It's tedious - I grew up loving Red Storm Riding, The Hunt for Red October, and Clear and Present Danger, but this book was trash. I leave you with its final words:""Ming went out to dinner--the restaurants hadn't closed--with her foreign lover, gushing over drinks and noodles with the extraordinary events of the day, then walked off to his apartment for a dessert of Japanese sausage.""",['Tom Clancy'],['Fiction']

We all know the tale of Scrooge and his visits by the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Even for those who have never read the book, the story has been retold in many different forms and at least three versions make their appearance on our television screens each Christmas.So why has this little tale proved to be so popular? I think it's because Scrooge is such a memorable character and we all know someone we like to think of as a Scrooge. And, let's be honest, we would like them to change. A Christmas Carol touches the desires of all of us to show people what they are really like and have them change for the better. And Scrooge is also one of those characters that seem to be likeable even when they're easy to dislike.I think this book is still worth reading, even though we know the story. It is a very small book. I read it in its entirety on Christmas Eve. It is also very easy to read. Some classics, I feel, are difficult for the modern reader because our tastes and expectations are different from those of the past. But because A Christmas Carol was written quickly by Dickens, and kept short, it will pose no problems to readers of today.Besides being a great tale, A Christmas Carol also gives us an insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in Victorian society. Don't wait until Christmas to read it!",['Charles Dickens'],['Christmas stories']

It's light, fun, sad, and presents an important message about Christmas. During this time of rampant commercialism and long lists to Santa, it's easy to forget that the greatest joys of Christmas come from the giving. This book illustrates the euphoria that Scrooge feels when he finally is able to give gifts, either of time, money, food, or whatever, to other people. Christmas is not about what you can get...it's about what you can give. If you want a story that will remind you of the real meaning of Christmas, this is it! In terms of story-telling, this book has classic Dickensian characters and ample humor and drama, making it a classic in its own right.

It didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' books and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style. What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made the book difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale. What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge. One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire book was too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I didn't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit. All in all, I found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters were unmemorable for me.",['Charles Dickens'],['Christmas stories']

However, don't get me wrong, this isn't the top book in the world. I still think that the books And Then There were none, and The 13th Platform, or The Westing Game are all a little bit better.

Start with a type, and you'll find you've got nothing.""In ""The Golden Compass"" Philip Pullman writes 'types', not characters. I struggled through hundreds of pages wondering why in the world I was supposed to like Lyra. I didn't, and I still don't. Why? She's a type, not a character. She's an icon of childhood ideals of sorts. A spritely, lively, free-spirited, exuberant thing. ie.) Moderately uninteresting caricature of childlike innocence.Pullman writes children like somebody who's studied them in psychology texts in order to write for them, but has never spoken to one. The writing otherwise is solid, and locales are nicely rendered, but I got bored fast with the use of his characters as nothing but wooden puppets to hang his pseudo-spiritual/metaphysical ideas and gadgets on. His personal philosophies are the real star of these stories, and it quickly becomes tiresome. Good essay material, yes. Compelling storytelling? Not really.Too much is arbitrary or unexplained besides. Why are there talking bears in a world otherwise grounded in realism, when other animals are just that? What IS dust anyway? You'll be three hundred pages in before you realize not a compelling word of explanation has been offered yet. String a reader along long enough, and he'll just stop caring. I was waist-deep in this story when I just stopped caring. The longer it got, the more acutely, annoyingly aware I became that this story was subdivided to cover three books for commercial reasons. The Golden Compass is, putting it simply, chock full of filler meant to spread the narrative thin enough to sell two more episodes. What ARE daemons? What about Iorek and the bears? Dust? Mrs Coulter? Ultimately, a lot more questions are raised than answered, but I simply stopped caring about the outcome. I don't think I'll be purchasing the next two books.Pullman is popular because his themes appeal to the present social/philosophical prejudices of the literary establishment. But that really doesn't change the fact that it's all pretty hamfisted, archetypical, and just plain uninteresting as a story. Neat ideas (though admittedly, blatant propaganda) marred by very average storytelling and one-dimensional characters. Stick to Rowling, Tolkien, and Lewis, not necessarily in that order.",,

The list of awards/recommendations on the cover was impressive, so I was expecting to read something decent for a change - after reading Crossroads of Twilight and being severely disappointed by Jordan, to be precise.Anyway, I'm not sure this book merits all its hype. I read it twice, and I liked it better the second time. The heroine struck me as an utter brat the first time around... too much of a brat to be real. I think I appreciated her after a while... she does mature over the course of the novel, but she still seems a bit unreal at times. And her manner of speaking is frequently odd. The way she calls the bear ""my dear"" near the end seems out of character, to cite an example. I recieved the impression that the author has had little experience with little girls in general.As for the story itself, it was original and interesting enough to keep my attention until the end. The plot moved along fast enough, and I held my breath at certain parts - a definite sign of a good book. I had no idea that it was supposed to be some sort of political statement on the Church.

He does. Not only does he blast the church and present members of the clergy as murderous villains, he introduces homosexual angels and informs the reader there is no God, just one angel who took control. Feeling like I had to finish the series in case the author changed the point of view, I struggled on.

From start to end there's hardly a sliver of light that seeps through, understandable as there is an apocalyptic outcome that everyone is expecting. The book is peopled with humans who have associated daemons who acquire a fixed animal form which reflects their personality post maturity, there are warrior bears, witches a small share of frightening evil creatures. The stage is set for a roller coaster fairy tale , except for the concept of Dust.The protagonist is a young lady (supposedly an orphan till we get to know better) called Lyra who lives in Oxford (same name but in a different world) , and is set on a course destined to change the world due to her witnessing a conversation between Lord Asriel and scholars of the university about Dust. The word Dust instills fear in a world controlled by the Church and a rather nasty outcrop of it, called the General Oblation Board. Lyra soon gets sucked into a series of events which gets her on a journey northbound (I'm afraid to say Arctic, as I'm not sure what its called in the book) with a bunch of gypsies to free children kidnapped by the General Oblation Board (Gobblers for short). She is up against the guiles of the diabolical Mrs Coulter whose idea the General Oblation Board is. There are many battles played out and the climax has a twist (there are a few on route too , esp. Lyra's identity), and on the whole a good entertainer.The crux of the book though is the rather blasphemous idea of what this strange particle called Dust does to an individual and that's what snaps your attention back to something deeper than just flying witches and fighting bears. The book only serves to illuminate the characteristics of Dust and not what it actually is which I hope the rest of the parts should do. There are a number of half answered questions at the end and if it weren't for the comfort of having the remaining two parts of the trilogy handy, I would have been a disenchanted reader. In a nutshell the book by itself is good at best , and should keep you sufficiently interestedfor the rest of the trilogy",,
B000P0LSAQ,The Golden Compass,,A2NHD7LUXVGTD3,doc peterson,3/7,5.0,1198281600,Fantastic! A wonderful story on many levels,"_The Golden Compass_ is set in a parallel universe, much like our own, where young Lyra Belaqua discovers she has a unique gift - she has the ability to ""read"" an alethiometer (the ""Golden Compass"") - a device that can be used to divine the future, learn the past, and become aware of events unfolding, even thousands of miles away. In the midst of this, young children are disappearing, which has a great deal to do with both Lyra's gift and the Compass she possesses.The marvelous thing about this book is that it has a wide appeal given that it tells a story on many levels. For younger readers (those between 8 - 11), it is a story of exploration and adventure with a strong female protagonist; for those slightly older (the 11 - 13 set), the story deals with coming of age, adolescence, rebellion and becoming your own person; for young adults, the parallels to quantum physics and the criticisms of theocracy (and organized religion in general) have appeal.I really enjoyed the story, especially for the broad appeal it offers. Recommended holiday reading.",,

With surprises around every corner, you'll find it harder and harder to put this darkly beautiful book down. Pullman's fantastic storytelling and the clever and fresh heroine Lyra Belacque have turned the imaginative fairy tale, The Golden Compass, into a classic and a must-read for children and adults alike.",,
B000P0LSAQ,The Golden Compass,,AINBFU12SHH01,josh bellin,0/2,3.0,1334188800,A Great Vision Undone by Allegory,"I can definitely see why lots of people love this book: it's beautifully written, incredibly imaginative, and (in some places) powerfully moving. The idea of parallel worlds is a marvelous one, and I was really impressed by how effortlessly Pullman creates Lyra's world: he lets it unfold on its own, with its own mystery and logic, and without heavy-handed exposition. So in those respects, I found the book entrancing.But by the same token, I found it deeply disappointing that all this wonderful stuff exists in the service of a not-very-interesting allegory about sin, religion, and the Catholic Church. To me, allegory sucks all the life out of literature: once you find out that each thing in the literary world stands for something else in the real world--once Dust becomes Original Sin--then there's no challenge, no mystery, no intrigue. The reader is no longer a partner in bringing the fantasy world to life; the reader becomes a mere pawn in the author's game.I don't object to religious discourse in fantasy literature, or even to religious critique; lots of my favorite works of fantasy, from The Lord of the Rings to the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, are rife with religious references and resonances. But in those works, the religious elements remain alive with possibility: Frodo resembles Christ, but he does not ""stand for"" Christ in any simple, one-to-one relationship. The reader is free to think about what Frodo MIGHT signify, rather than being told by the author what he DOES signify.I find it weird, in this respect, that Pullman, who obviously dislikes what he sees as the Church's stranglehold on its believers, wrote a book that maintains a similar strangehold on its readers. I wish he'd done without the allegorical frame and just let his fantastic world be whatever the reader wanted it to be.",,

Actually, that's not completely true. The boy who was severed from his daemon and eventually died--I forget his name--that one broke my heart.The story did pick up a little towards the end even though it was a slog getting there. I may continue on with the series some day, but for now I'm giving it a rest.",,

Patterson,0/0,4.0,1352505600,Fantasy Sci-Fi for Someone Who Normally Doesn't Read it,"Fantasy sci-fi doesn't hold much appeal for me, likewise the Harry Potter franchise. I did like the Golden Compass movie (sorry they didn't make more of them) for if nothing else its steampunk-y aesthetic, so I gave source material a try. The film softened a few key aspects of the book and simplified the cast of characters, but it's all here and then some. What was enjoyable about the audio book was that it was conceived almost like a radio play, the author is lead narrator with about a dozen talented voice actors animating the characters. I'd give the book a ""good,"" and will probably come back to the remaining installments at some point, but I'm not slavering to know how it all turns out.",,
B000P0LSAQ,The Golden Compass,,A30L3P0LRDLZ4O,Moon Shim,0/0,5.0,1353801600,Better than the movie,"Let's be honest here: I actually watched the movie before I read the book, and so by doing so, I thought it would be a waste of time to try and read this book, since I have this ""inner thinking"" that books are for movies, and movies are superior. However, as just like the harry potter series, I was wrong: the book is far more exciting and intriguing than the movie, and possibly, longer.Lyra is a troubled child who lives in a college with the scholars and is a daughter of a powerful couple: Lord Asriel and Lady Colter. Mostly everything is going well, after witnessing a scholar meeting in the college, her life changes.Although most of you will already know at least SOME part of the story, but since some new people who would be interesting in getting the trilogy comes in to look with absolutely no idea, I will be giving away some of the facts in the book.First of all, what is with all this ""dark materials""? you may get the idea from the title of this first book, the golden compass, it is actually not clear where this ""dark"" comes from(but you will know it when you read the next book, the subtle knife) but it is basically these lists of magical ITEMS with different properties and purposes in the world, and one of them now lies in Lyra's hands.The golden compass, or more professionally noted as the althiometer, is a tool in which comes in a form of a watch, or a compass made with gold outlines and four hands that points to each picture. Every picture has its own meanings, and though even the brightest of all scholars could only use it by reading a very complicated encyclopedia. Lyra, on the other hand, was able to master the device in weeks, and now uses it freely to have an over watch on the rest of the world.What does it mean? The movie itself made clear of that: the child is special. How? Don't bloody ask me! Read it yourself! The book itself could be described as adventurous, fiction, exciting, wonderful plot, and very original. I enjoyed every last words of the book, I hope you do to.",,

He is presenting the reader with an example of a society that has gone wrong, totally wrong, and he wants the world to be aware that the direction in which it is headed is not for the best, and in fact the world should stay as far away from extreme conformity as possible. The world of which Huxley writes is the antithesis of what the human race really needs.",['Aldous Huxley'],['Fiction']

B000P4Q3JS,Wuthering Heights (The Franklin Library),,A2OU2NCXK689Z2,"Tigger ""kkegley""",15/16,3.0,1220918400,A bit of a letdown,"Often held up as the standard of the classic gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is, for the most part, a showcase of emotional savagery and a dismal portrayal of the human heart. Not well received when first published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, Emily Bronte went to her grave believing that her one and only novel was a complete failure. A subsequent edition, edited by sister Charlotte, was released after Emily's death and became a worldwide success.Everyone has heard the name Heathcliff, and that must be due to his being surely one of the vilest, most hateful literary characters to ever exist on a page. An unidentified foundling who is brought to the Earnshaw home as a young boy, Heathcliff is forever painfully aware of his lack of identity and culture and lashes out at everyone with whom he comes into contact. For awhile, his dearest childhood ally, Catherine, is his one sanctuary, but in time he begins to hate her almost as much as he loves her. From that hatred is born several generations of misery and pain, as Heathcliff devotes his entire existence to ruining Catherine, her family, and everything she ever held dear, and no one is immune from Heathcliff's wrath - not even his own children.Most of the story is told as a look-back by aging housekeeper Nelly Dean as she relates the whole sordid tale to Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who comes to Wuthering Heights to rent for a short time and becomes curious about his angry, tormented landlord. The past soon fuses into the present, as Heathcliff's revenge continues to plague both his and Catherine's hapless descendants.As dark and depressing a story as it appears on the surface, Bronte's unfettered examination of the twin emotions of intense love and equally intense hatred is powerful, and stays with the reader long after the last page has been turned. It's nothing if not a poignant and eerie lesson in the damage one person's tortured soul can wreak on everyone around him. I found myself much more affected by it than I thought I would be. Recommended for any fan of classic literature, particularly the gothic era of the 19th century.",['Emily Brontë'],
B000P4Q3JS,Wuthering Heights (The Franklin Library),,A3DPJQKYK28ZCO,Paul K,1/1,5.0,1287878400,Excellent formatted book for younger readers,"I bought a set of these books for my 7th grade English class. The book is designed perfectly for the young readers, especially girls. My students were very excited about reading the novel when they saw the cover of the book. The font of the novel is quite large and because of this the book is almost 500 pages; this put off some of the students because they were worried about reading such a large book. However, I explained that it made it easier to read and to take notes in because of the larger print and margins. There is also a pedigree chart in the book and a character reference section that certainly made it more understandable to my students. Also, as we read it, they got more and more excited when they saw how far they would get in just one reading. This book has a Lexile reading score of 880, which is a 6th grade beginning reading level, however, it is quite a difficult read for younder audiences because of the period grammar. My students read quite far above their grade level and most had difficulty with comprehension. I don't know if I will read it again next year because of the grammar, it does suit an older reader, but I do love sharing the story. After we completed the novel, they did complain about the words, but they really loved the story and were sad when we finished the novel.",['Emily Brontë'],
B000P4Q3JS,Wuthering Heights (The Franklin Library),,A211ZWSDFTMAK5,Sonia,1/1,5.0,1291248000,A Simple yet Exceptional Book,"I read this book because I had to teach it in a literature class about three years ago. The novel is poetical in nature, but it uses simple words to unravel the romantic twist in the novel. Catherine who is the center of the novel is in love with two men in her life one who she loves dearly and the other who she married for money. The two men in the novel Edgar Linton and Heathcliff are definitely in love with her. Edgar Linton shows his love for her by staying as a widower even after Catherine's death. By contrast, Heathcliff seeks to revenge his treatment by the Earnshaw family. At the end of the novel the two men who are in love with Catherine are buried close to her.One theme that stands out in the novel is that of love. What does it mean to love someone dearly? How does loving someone manifest itself in the lives of women and men? Is it possible to carry out nefarious act because of love? The responses to these questions are answered in the way the plot of the novel turns out. Through her prose, Emily Bronte answers these questions. Love to her means to be faithful to a partner despite the person's flawed character. Love can be seen as delicate subject which can lead to someone conducting baneful actions, as well as conducting acts of kindness.In a sensational group of compound sentences, Bronte shows her readers how love can be convoluted sentiment in women ""My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.""",['Emily Brontë'],

If you are to believe the 1978 one, also tremendously long-winded and boring. The book, however, is not long-winded and it's not confusing either. It's got decent pacing, good characters (even though there are a number of DSM-IV labels that can be distributed liberally amongst them) and passion. Lots and lots of passion. Not necessarily of the bodice-ripping kind, but passion and fury. Especially the latter.Problem is, as much as I enjoyed reading the book and Emily Bront's writing, which is a lot more succinct than her sister Charlotte's, I don't like any of the characters and I have no sympathy for any of them, save for narrator Nelly/Ellen, because they're all a bunch of b*st*rds who deserve a good slap! I know, I know, it was written a long time ago, but I get the feeling that Emily didn't particularly like the people she wrote about either. They're either violent, drunkards, narcissists or just plain emo. But yes, aside from wanting to give the majority of the cast a good shake and yell ""wake up and smell the coffee!"" at them, it's still a good read. Yes, even though it's a little bit depressing and everyone hates each other and people die. Some people you're quite relieved to see the end of.The edition I have (Wordsworth Classics - cheap and cheerful!) comes with a glossary to be able to interpret ye olde English. Some of the words feel a bit unnecessary, because they're either fairly common knowledge or you can grasp the meaning by the context, whereas others ... well, any time poor old Joseph opens his mouth, you need a translator. Yorkshire dialect, 18th/19th century, oww. English isn't even my first language, so it was a tad bit difficult to read. The rest of the book wasn't a problem, just the bits in dialect.The book is actually a lot better than any of the adaptations I've seen. Emily's prose is atmospheric and timeless. Some of her words keep being repeated in the adaptations because, well, they're worth it. Notably this one, which is very passionate:""My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.""See, that's goosebumps right there. How profound, how passionate, how... obsessive and bordering on deranged! But that's what I like about it. It tells a compelling (and rather violent) story of a couple of star-crossed lovers who live miserable ever after. What would it have been like if Cathy and Heathcliff had decided to get married? That's what I'd like to know.Anyway, it's a book that exceeded my expectations. I thought it'd just be weird and confusing like the adaptations, but no, it was actually pretty good. It was well written, and to think all of that came out of a parson's daughter living a fairly sheltered life in a small Yorkshire town. Just shows how good her imagination was, and her skill with a pen.",['Emily Brontë'],

My recollections of the great love of Cathy and Heathcliff's turned to impatience with the angst filled duo and a shocking realization that I did not like either of these individuals well.But that being said, I found I appreciated the second half of the book much more than my first read which I must have barely skimmed with the great love being physically impossible. Nor did I forgive Heathcliff as I once did, because my enthusiasm for bad boys has waned over the years.But the question remained for me, when I was forced to rebuild my thoughts regarding this classic novel, was what made it so, what did it have to offer over the centuries to us today? It is a truly atmospheric novel that presents the cold and cruel world of the Yorkshire moors, which seems to shape people in its own fashion. But the value of the book perhaps, is a look at the many faces of love, and what people will do in the name of love.Bronte's Wuthering Heights is a true classic in that each reader can take a lesson from it.",['Emily Brontë'],

From my first reading at the age of 12, I was and remain intrigued by the format of the novel: told by a rather dim-witted tenant intrigued by his decidedly odd neighbor/landlord named Heathcliff after he hears the tale from his housekeeper of Thrushcross Grange in remote Yorkshire during two lengthy stays. It's a complicated and elegant structure that serves the reader very well. As a 'tween I was captivated by the romance of Wuthering Heights. In my 20s and 30s it was Catherine Earnshaw Linton, who chose respectability over passion, who interested me. In my 40s, I looked again at Heathcliff, who is just about the most diabolical and evil man in literature. And now in my 50s I find myself especially interested in Catherine Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff's chosen victim for his revenge of the supposed sins committed against him by her parents. She is the daughter of two weak parents: Catherine Earnshaw, whose mind and body broke before she reached the age of 20, and Edgar Linton, who lacked the physical vigor to fight Heathcliff or protect his daughter. Yet though Heathcliff chooses Catherine Linton Heathcliff for his revenge, she is no victim, and it is Heathcliff's inability to destroy her that leads to his ultimate despair and death. To many readers, the story of the second Catherine feels tacked on (and many movie versions leave it out altogether), but in it resides Emily Bronte's message. The second Catherine and second Hareton offer a new start for Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a new kind of masters -- not a pampered and privileged pair who've been protected from the harshness of the world, but a couple who've survived the worst treatment that Heathcliff could devise for them and have emerged with their humanity intact.",['Emily Brontë'],

The reason there are ""1,000"" reviews of the Norton Critical Fourth Edition of Wuthering Heights is that Amazon is dumping all the reviews of any edition of Wuthering Heights into one worthless jumble. Note that the initial description of ""the book"" is actually a detailed review of an Audio CD version referred to as an adequate abridgement.

Try finding a chronologically ordered list of a mystery series here. Would it be hard to create one? Of course not. But who cares? Not Amazon.Where this database slovenliness get criminal is when Amazon piles together British and U.S. editions of an author's work with no indication that a ""new title"" is actually the U.K. title of a book already available in the U.S. (Carol O'Connell's Magic Men is Shell Game, Find Me is Shark Music, etc.). The luckless shopper ends up with a duplicate title and shipping charges up the wazoo. Even worse is the conflation of prints of classic films, where a review of a blurry knockoff edition of Seven Samurai gets a top listed review that praises the sharp quality of the DVD and fails to mention that the review refers to the pricey Criterion edition.

I have listened to her narrate two or three books and in each of them my opinion was the same; when she is narrating in her natural voice it is pleasing enough, but when she is doing character voices she manages to make them all sound like 80-year-old women who have been lifelong smokers.

Peterman,5/6,5.0,954720000,Jane Eyre--A Century Before Her Time,"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection.",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Literary Criticism']

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,,A25UKEI6GAQTCA,adrienne zillmann,5/6,5.0,989798400,My Opinion of Jane Eyre,"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from.",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Literary Criticism']

But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.""Jane Eyre"" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being. I've read of other reviewers who read this book at an early age and felt it changed their lives.I'm part of that club.Now, stop reading this and go read ""Jane Eyre.""",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Literary Criticism']
B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,,A1CK4GMTJWP1MZ,TigerTie,5/6,5.0,1103068800,So deep and thought provoking,"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader.",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Literary Criticism']

It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting.

B000P91JYW,Jane Eyre,,A31G0WF211QK50,Chelsea,5/6,4.0,1110672000,Jane Eyre - A True Classic,"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. ""`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, `you have my full and free forgiveness'"" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. ""Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love"" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. ""I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless"" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple ""no"" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery.",['Charlotte Brontë'],['Literary Criticism']

The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, ""Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.""Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: ""It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.""

The story starts with George and Lenny working on a farm in a town called 'weed'. George is a very intelligent man and Lenny is a mentally challenged giant. One day while at work, Lenny sees a woman with a red dress on and goes up to talk to her. He gets into trouble when he goes up to her because he does something he should not but does not realize that he is doing anything wrong. He and George then have to run to another farm because they do not want to get caught for what Lenny has done. They need to keep working because their ultimate goal is to own a ranch of their own where Lenny can raise rabbits and they can both live off the 'fatta the lan.' They get to the next ranch the next day and meet the people around there. There is a very nice man, 'Slim', and poor black man and old man, and the worst character of the book, a mean, cocky man, Curley. They work at the farm for a few weeks until Lenny gets in trouble again with an incident similar to the first. The story ends shortly after this and is ended in a very well way. This book is one of the greatest books I have read, not to mention it only being 107 pages long. Steinbeck is a great author and has produced many great books including 'The Grapes of Wrath,' another great novel of his. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be able to read a story in just a short couple of hours. This is the shortest book that I've ever read but also the most touching and realistic book that I've read.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

Since the Great Depression influences all parts of society, economy and the everday life circumstances are quite difficult for them.Firstly you have to mention that Steinbeck seems to be crazy about details. The very beginning of each chapter is decribed up to the smallest thing consequently the reader gets a good impression where the action takes place. Otherwise his description sometimes seem to be exaggerated and a special background knowlegde is necessary to understand his hidden evidences. Anyways the language Steinbeck's character use is quite pleasant to read if you like American English. Due to this language the character seem to be pretty realistic furthermore it gives the reader a good opportunity to get along with the story in general. Moreover Steinbeck created a lot of different characters, with a lot of different attiudes in addition to that a lot of trouble makes the reader turn to the next page and go on with reading. This mentioned trouble also leads to the end when George kills his best friend Lennie who is retarded. By the way this act compromises also an ethic question. Was this an act of euthanasia or just a cold blooded murder?Make your own impression and read the book but do not expect too much action otherwise you will be disappointed.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']

B000PGYVZ4,OF MICE AND MEN,,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,stoic,0/0,3.0,1247616000,Not Up to Its Reputation,"Of Mice and Men has by now attained the status of one of those books that we are ""supposed to read."" I finally got around to reading it this summer (2009). OM&M; is consistently interesting reading. But it did not move me as much as the best books that I have read.The best thing that I can say about OM&M; is that it is a book that you want to read. John Steinbeck's protagonists, George and Lennie, are so vividly drawn that they ""come to life"" for the reader. As a result, I found that I cared about both men's fates and I cheered for them to succeed.Steinbeck also does a good job of crafting vivid descriptions of the grubby conditions in which George and Lennie live their lives; readers will find it easy to picture the scenes that Steinbeck describes. OM&M; contains several strong scenes. The scene in which the men debate whether to shoot Candy's dog is powerful and important to Steinbeck's overall message. The opening scene in which George and Lennie walk down the dusty road toward the ranch also contains many memorable images and some good dialogue.In other ways, I thought that OM&M; was lacking. OM&M; is depressingly unsubtle. Steinbeck incessantly hammers away at his themes. For instance, Steinbeck makes the point that Lennie does NOT like to fight so many times that I lost count. Another overworn point is that the men dream of living on land that they own. Steinbeck seems to have worried that his readers were not sufficiently intelligent to draw the conclusions that he wanted them to draw. He attempted to compensate through redundancy.More damagingly, Steinbeck sets up a simplistic universe in which good, strong workers struggle against heartless bosses. Unlike George and Lennie, the people that they work for are sloppily-drawn caricatures. The fact that Steinbeck describes one character only as ""Curley's wife"" provides an idea of the slapdash manner in which Steinbeck draws the ""villains."" I don't want to include a spoiler in my review, but I believe that OM&M; would have been more powerful if ""Curley's wife"" had been less of a caricature. Had she been even moderately sympathetic, OM&M; would challenge its readers to answer more-difficult questions. Steinbeck's immunity to nuance drains the power and realism from OM&M.;Finally, OM&M;'s last chapter includes a scene in which Lennie has surreal visions. This is a daring tactic. Steinbeck uses it to try to illustrate Lennie's internal struggle. It is only partially successful as it introduces a jarring shift in the perspective Steinbeck uses in the rest of the book. Lennie's visions are interesting, but the manner in which Steinbeck presents the visions makes the reader aware of Steinbeck's overly-heavy hand.OM&M; is a good, quick (118-page) read. But, in my humble opinion, it is no better than good.",['John Steinbeck'],['Fiction']
B000PGYVZ4,OF MICE AND MEN,,A2N6ULDUETUAVU,Ravenhurst,3/4,2.0,1256774400,It was...alright,"First and foremost, let me note that my review and negative rating has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed swearing in the book. The fact that people mention the word ""damn"" and ""hell"" with the ocassional insult don't and shouldn't constitute as heavy-duty swearing. It is in no way inappropriate for ninth graders - most ninth graders use far fouler language in everyday life than that mentioned in the book. The way that Crooks is referred to (some prefer to call in the ""n"" word) is not always an insult - it is simply how people called others of different coloring. I just felt that I had to explain my reasons, that's all. Moving on, the book isn't entirely bad. Steinbeck's ideas are convincing, and even though slightly depressing, I (as a reader), felt that they were not expressed entirely well. I found the repetition of certain words, purposeful or not, somewhat badly done. It just did not achieve what could supposedly be the intended effect.The characters could have been described in a much more detailed manner. Since this book was probably written with the goal of a novel easily adapted to theatre, the fact that description was toned down was understandable - but still, it felt very lacking. Though the description used for George and Lennie made it easy to picture the two main characters, again, the repetition of certain words really detracted from the passage as a whole. One thing that gave the novel the impression that it was rushed was the fact that some characters that were introduced in the beginning of the chapter two didn't really play a part later on. For instance, the Boss, Curley's father, seemed to have importance in chapter two, but he faded into obscurity after that. The dialogue, on the other hand, is quite fluid and natural.Even though the conflict in the book was very obvious, it could have been worked on and produced with much more profundity. The ending as it is is powerful on its own, but I can't help but feel that something is missing.All in all, that concludes my review.

And he did create a wonderful, if highly eurocentric, world.But this book fails because of its incessant praise of war. The Nazis were evil because of the Holocaust. What did the Allies do to stop that? Not much (didn't even bomb the tracks leading to the death camps). War is simply evil; the sad lesson of the 20th Century is that warriors only contribute to the problem (Hiroshima) and only peacemakers fight evil effectively. (MLK, Ghandi, Einstein)Tolkein should be criticised for glorifing war because he: (1) wrote for children, is very popular, and (3)is credited with greatness. But Tolkein set up a world where war is becomes the essentially bloodless killing of evil subhumans or spirits. As in Beowulf, there's no horror, just glory. The enemies, who live in a &quot;black and evil land&quot; can't be reasoned with, only killed. (Contrast this with the Iliad). Real evil never works that way; Hitler came from the same people that produced Beethoven and Goethe. Speaking of which, the the book's subhumans are so gleefully killed, that one wonders how Lord of the Rings would have been received if the author were german and not british.It's too bad really. Tolkein had a magnificent imagination, made evident by the wonderful interplay between the Dwarf Gimli and the Elf Legolas--they eventually learn to overlook and finally appreciate their differences.

Moreover, this edition is published as the story was meant to be read: with all three &quot;books&quot; in one (many uneducated folk scorned the 2001 movie's unsatisfying ending, which was meant to be merely a cliff-hanger leading into the immediately ensuing chapter). True, the size may render it unwieldy for younger fans (PLEASE take great care), but part of the treasure of this edition is its textile feel and weight, its &quot;sprawl out in front of the fireplace&quot; nature, for this is not a magazine to skim but a treasure trove to ponder and study. It contains a huge fold-out map with comprehensive place-names, as well as family trees and guides for translating the various runic languages.

It has a huge cast of characters, every one with a mythology behind them that is barely hinted at in the book (but is expanded on in the appendices and other works connected to Middle-Earth) and an amazing attention to details of towns, cities and landscapes, it has more songs than you can shake a stick at and it even has its own languages. Unfortunately, the plot is poor and Tolkien's ambition far exceeds his skills. His language is stilted to the highest degree, the language is fanciful and far too archaic and the dialogue is frankly awful. When a book's appendices are more interesting than the main text, you know you're in trouble. The problem is that the Lord of the Rings is caught halfway between ""The Hobbit"" (which is more colloquial and much more engaging), and what would become ""The Silmarrilion"", which has both a plot and a cast to match the pseudo-epic tone that Tolkien often adopts. You would probably be better off watching the films rather than reading the book with this one, simply because the films achieve everything that Tolkien fails to (although the last half-hour of the third film is truly awful).

I organized a book club with a few friends some time ago, and one of our members chose this book (much to my initial disappointment).My impression after 100 pages or so was that Barbara Kingsolver is a brilliant writer, but that the story was a bit tedious. I couldn't have been more wrong. Kingsolver sets the scene with the first 150 pages and then takes off, launching a spellbinding tale about an overzealous and arrogant missionary who drags his wife and four daughters into the heart of darkness in the Belgian Congo (circa 1959). As though you didn't know that bad things happen when someone attempts to push his culture onto others who see the world in their own way, we are told that a tragedy will unfold in the very first chapter.The story is told from the perspective of the missionary's wife and four daughters, and each character comes alive on paper. Each speaks in a unique voice, sees the world in a unique way, and has a different way of dealing with the difficult situation that they slowly find themselves in. As a man, I was at first dismayed that Kingsolver chose to leave out the male perspective by only presenting us with the female family-members' points of view; however, this turns out to have been the wiser decision. This is by no means a male bashing book (although a few other reviewers here seem to think so), and I find it hard to believe that anyone who has actually finished this book could draw that conclusion.A great college course could be taught on this one book.

I have a great love of language, especially writing, but I found the opening chapter confusing. Yet my initial skepticism was quickly overcome by the unique structure of the book with each chapter alternately told by one of the four sisters in a manner that was effective in contrasting their different personalities and points of view about their common experiences during their first two years in Africa. These chapters passed quickly for me, and I was through most of the book in just a few days --- greatly enjoying learning about the African culture and being enlightened about the terrible consequences of colonialism. I became impatient, however, with the last fourth of the book in which months and then years passed between chapters. In the end, I came away with a great admiration for Ms. Kingsolver's technical skill in alternately using four main voices to tell her story. But as I thought longer, I felt that the four voices were simply highly effective fictional tools to relate the great political and social injustice that has occurred in the former Belgian Congo during and since colonialism. The book's four main voices and other characters served as a means to a political and social cause. Some, Leah, Adah, Ruth Ann, were better drawn than others, Axelroot, Nathan, Rachel.

If I cannot afford to send each of them abroad to gain perspective on life outside the United States then perhaps I can ask them to read this book. American's today tend to idealize the 1950's and this book takes place just when that decade was wrapping up. America was still basking in the righteous victory of WWII and enjoying the grandfatherly governance of Uncle Ike Eisenhower. Did you know that while that was going on that the US government was busy overthrowing democratically elected governments and murdering leaders in Africa because of interests in mineral mining? Did you know that this has contributed strongly to a legacy of madmen dictators during Africa's initial post colonial period? All of this was going on while America was enjoying the fabled era of poodle skirts and cherry cokes and Africa is still paying the price today. There is one singular flaw in the way Kingsolver wrote this book. The patriarch of the American missionary family, Nathan Price, is an extreme caricature of close mindedness and intolerance. I have met people like him but he is so over the top that readers could be put off the entire story. That caricature does mean to me that Kingsolver is leading us by the nose with this fable.

Lots of people call it a trilogy, but I can only agree with that idea in that the three segments were initially published seperately in the years 1954, 1955, and 1956. Besides that, one has to notice that each segment is incomplete without the others. A trilogy would contain three complete stories, like the original Star Wars trilogy. Well, its time I got on with my two cents of TFOTR. After The Hobbit was published, the fantasy genre was revived in a way that gave Arthur and his knights a run for their money. Fantasy was back, 20th century style. People begged for a sequel, and Tolkien delivered one beyond anybody's expectations and imagination. TFOTR begins to answer the questions that resulted at the end of The Hobbit. This, I feel, is its main purpose. It doesn't have as much action as the two later segments, but instead focuses on why a new quest is to begin. It does have its moments of action, but most of suspense and intrigue comes from revelations. Thats why The Hobbit should be read first. It would be a mistake not to. It is true that is somwhat slow in the beginning, but the suspense and wonder of a ruling ring just glides in the story. Suddenly, what happened with Bilbo's quest becomes very importent. It was in TFOTR that Tolkien introduced Middle-Earth and its history. A person forgets that they're reading fantasy in LOTR. It feels very real, and once TFOTR gets though the beginning, it doesn't let go. The only real bad part is that it leaves you hanging in the end, forcing you to read The Two Towers and making you wish that you had a single volume edition. I've been to Middle-Earth, and I deeply regreted having to leave for a while. Read this masterpiece (LOTR) before you die.

A simple book as it was, it became the stepping stone to probably one of the greatest writings of all time. The Hobbit was my favorite book, and two years later, the memory of Middle-earth and all its splendor came to me, again. I decided to pick up The Lord of the Rings, a story much more in depth than The Hobbit, much more dark and mysterious than a simple journey to the East to retrieve a dragon's loot. It tells of an Evil coming over the magical land of Middle-earth, and a simple hobbit's quest to destory the One Ring that could save them all. It is but a simple, unadorned ring, just as this story is a short, simple story, and yet underneath the surface, it is much more than what it seems to be.When you read The Lord of the Rings, you are drawn into the mystical land that J.R.R.

Naturally fantasy tends to be very popular with young adults (it was with me), but Tolkien's work seems to transcend demographics. This is not a book for escapists nor for those who prefer a reality that is in opposition to our own. This is a book for those who desire to understand reality and look for magic in the process of discovery. Tolkien uses human traits and physical realities to create a world of complicated and mysterious morality - a world where a wizard Gandalf the Grey is somehow more pure than his colleague, Saruman the White.People are rarely what they appear to be and neither are hobbits. Frodo Baggins, the protagonist hobbit, is the ring bearer. He like many human heros in other books carries an unasked and heavy burden. He does not carry it with a saint's gracious self-immolation, but rather with a determination to do what he thinks is right for himself and those who depend on him. Like anyone in a situation like this, he desires to cast his burden off, but gathers the courage to continue. The admirable thing about Tolkien is that Frodo does not make these decisions based on some blind fervor for an unattainable ideal, but rather through a series of inductive steps. In this way Frodo transforms the ideal of saintliness into syllogism.Frodo would prefer to kick back with a pint of ale beneath a tree, but he doesn't. Through logic and reason, he determines that unless he begins his perilous journey and defeats the great evil spreading across the land, neither he nor anyone else will ever be able to see simple joy again.It is a story about magic of course, but the magic serves as an ideal that the realists strive to protect, not worship. They are rooted in reality, as is this tale. All fantasy writers since Tolkien owe a great deal to the style and imagination of this writer, but the greatest gift he gave them was the gift of realist fantasy. Rest assured that Tolkien is not simply the progenitor of a generation of better writers. He is a master among masters.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Adventure stories']

However, I would like to say that, if you are new to Tolkien's work and are thinking about reading The Lord of the Rings because of the impending movie then I can say that The Fellowship of the Ring is the easiest of the three books to read that make up the trilogy. The film that is to be released in December is this part of the story, with the other 2 films (The Two Towers and The Return of the King) to be made next year and the year after. The Fellowship of the Ring is such a good book to read. It is full of innocence, magic, terror and wonder. Tolkien conjurs this world of loveable Hobbits and ultimate, brooding evil. In this, the first book, you get a real insight into hobbit life and the beginnings of the adventures that Frodo makes to destroy the one ring. The other two books are great, of course, but the story gets more political and I feel they demand much more from the reader, especially The Return of the King. If you want to dabble in a bit of fantasy literature, then you can do no better than this book.

It's one of those classics where you can just keep on reading on and on and you don't want to finish. Yes, this book just captivated me with the adventure, suspense, excitement, and humor.&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins (read J.R.R. Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themLost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;. Have &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; on hand.My favorite character has got to be the Elf, Legolas. Elves have always fascinated me, for their mysterious, quiet, and almost immortal ways. I love it also how Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf in this book are sort of unfriendly towards each other since Elves and Dwarves usually do not get along. But towards the end of this book and the rest of the trilogy, they're the greatest of friends and inseparable.Another good character is Pippin the hobbit with his bright and cheerful ways. One of the youngest of the group of hobbits, he is always in a positive mood but somehow manages to get in trouble often.All of the books in the trilogy are must reads. Also the prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, should also be read to understand the events which had happened before the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Though it is written mostly for adults, I'm sure teenagers wil also love it, though younger kids might not be able to understand it. Enjoy, this book will have you fascinated and keep you in total suspense!",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Adventure stories']
B000Q9I494,Fellowship of the Ring 2ND Edition,,A3GRU9732S4V1U,"Robert Jenkins ""video geek #1""",5/6,5.0,1009152000,The first part of the GREATEST fantasy ever....,"Lord of the Rings is truly monumental fiction. I've read fantasy from many, many different authors, including Terry Brooks, Piers Anthony, Stephen R. Donaldson, Terry Goodkind, Robert Jordan, to name only a few, and I have come to the conclusion that every fantasy author in the last fifty years has borrowed from Tolkein to one extent or another.The basic plot of the book is fairly simple. Frodo Baggins is a hobbit who inherits a Ring of Power form his uncle Bilbo Baggins. At first glance, the Ring seems to be a good thing, posessing the power to turn its wearer invisible (a power which saved uncle Bilbo several times during his own adventure, chronicled in The Hobbit). However, the wizard Gandalf learns that the Ring is in fact the One Ring, created millenia ago by the evil Dark Lord Sauron, and removed from his posession by thr forces of good. Sauron was weakened by his loss, but now he has recovered strength and wants his Ring back. Once he gets it, he will have the power to conquer the world. The only way to keep the Ring from his grasp is to destroy it, and this can only be done by casting the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was originally created. Naturally, Mount Doom lies in the very heart of Sauron's realm in Mordor, so the quest is fraught with peril. Frodo and his faithful servant Sam, along with others, take on the task of the destruction of the Ring and the salvation of Middle-Earth. Fellowship of the Ring chronicles the first part of this story, which concludes with The Two Towers and Return of the King.If that was all there was to this book, it would be mo more than a first-rate work of fantasy. But, what lifts this book out of the realm of &quot;fantasy&quot; and into the realm of classic literature is the backstory. Lord of the Rings is essentially the conclusion of an incredible mythology that stretches back for over 7,000 Years of the Sun, and for who knows how many millenia before that. Tolkein worked on this mythology for several decades before Lord of the Rings was published, and references to it are sprinkled liberally throughout. The language and songs of the Elves are the best example of this, but there are many others.The pace of the book does slow a little in places, but that is only becuase several long expository sections are essential to give the reader the full story behind the Ring and how it made its journey from the hand of Sauron to the posession of Frodo. But, the book nevertheless has the power to draw you in. I've read this book over 20 times since I first discovered it in the early 1980's, and I still have not gotten tired of the wonder of this book.I do want to make one comment on the latest version of the book, however. I've noticed that many people have criticized the maps in the book as too difficult to read. I've looked at some of the newer copies, and I have to agree with this. I would like to point out that the map in these new copies is NOT the original map drawn by Tolkein himself, nor is it the revised map drawn by his son. The older maps are much better drawn, though the text is a little small. Frankly, if the new maps (drawn by Shelly Shapiro) bother you, I would suggest that you prowl through a local used bookstore and pick up an older copy of the trilogy, preferably the beautifully done Ballantine paperbacks of the early-to-mid 1980's. In addition to much better maps, the cover art on those books is beautiful. The one-volume red hardback version is also very nice, and you should be able to find a nice copy of it new.Books like the Harry Potter series are OK. They are light and enjoyable reading, but 100 years from now, they will be forgotten. Not The Lord of the Rings. It's a major classic of English literature, and it is THE classic of fantasy fiction.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Adventure stories']

Inglis's narration and characterization have helped me understand the plot and characters better. In particular, he gives delightful and moving readings of the poetry--the stories within the story of Frodo's adventure.

Fortunately, the release of Peter Jackson's excellent film adaptation of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" gives me a fresh perspective from which to review J.R.R. Tolkien's novel.If you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book, which you will almost certainly also enjoy, even if in a different way. One of the glories of Jackson's film is its great richness and depth, the feeling it gives the viewer of stepping into an unfamiliar but real world with a long history. The reason Jackson's film is able to produce this effect is that the world in which it takes place had already been created, and imagined in almost unbelievable detail, by J.R.R. Tolkien. Far more even than the movie, Tolkien's book lets the reader share the hobbits' experience of wandering out of their doors into a world with a detailed and believable history, a multitude of different mortal and immortal races with distinct cultures and languages, and a well-defined geography (maps are included in the book). I must place special emphasis on the linguistic depth of Tolkien's world: Tolkien, a distinguished philologist, invented around fifteen languages for the inhabitants of his imaginary world to speak. (The ""Star Trek"" Universe, by contrast, contains only one language, Klingon, which has been devised in any detail.)Moreover, as with any cinematic adaptation of a work of literature, Jackson's movie leaves out characters, events and scenes from the book. These elements are waiting in Tolkien's text for fans of the movie to discover them. In particular, the chapters involving a character named Tom Bombadil are among the best parts of the book, although they had to be left out of the movie to keep it down to a reasonable length.Anyone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world. The film's exchange between Frodo and Gandalf in which Frodo wishes the Shadow of evil had not arisen in his time comes directly from the book, which also contains a few other moments that resonate strongly with the current world situation. Tolkien was writing ""The Lord of the Rings"" during World War II, but he did not intend it as an allegory of that war or of any other specific situation; rather, he hoped that readers would feel free to find his work applicable to any scenario they might see reflected in it.""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is, in fact, not a novel, but the first volume of the three-part novel ""The Lord of the Rings."" Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie of ""Fellowship"" will surely want to read the two subsequent volumes, ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King,"" to find out what happens to the characters without having to wait for the release of the two subsequent movies at Christmas in 2002 and 2003.",['John Ronald Reuel Tolkien'],['Adventure stories']

WRONG! The Hobbit was pretty decent; I finished that in a few days. Then I started Fellowship. After 150 pages I couldn't take it anymore! I put it back in the box and forgot about it. I made a second attempt a year later, but only made it to page 50. I am now on my third attempt and I am GOING to finish it this time because it's driving me MAD.Now, it's not that it's not a good story. I respect Tolkien for his imagination and creativity. You can tell that he put his whole soul into this book and you can't bash someone's soul (reason for the 3 stars...), but clearly, not everybody's souls match up, so to speak. Personally, I like to feel a certain degree of empathy for characters in a story. I don't care how many leaves the 52nd tree to the north has, but I would like care about the characters. This book leaves you identifying more with topography and three page long descriptions of sunsets and such than with the characters. And I don't understand what the deal with the songs are. I hope they aren't that important because I just skip them. Derry dol, Merry dol, who cares? Jeez.Obviously, there are people who like this book, and if you're the type of person who likes to be given vast descriptions of things for the neurons in your brain to construct, then you should get this. Maybe you will even feel something for the characters. Everyone's different, otherwise this book would be as beloved as it is. If you would rather read something that moves you and stirs empathy, then go for something else.I haven't said anything new, but I need to suggestion this: I made assumptions and wasted $30 on a boxed set that I will probably never finish. PLEASE don't buy the boxed set! Just buy the first book to see if you like it, and then if you don't, you won't feel OBLIGED to read them like I do. (I guess I just have OCD or something.

Sure, Tolkien created a interesting world full of unusual people. But must he go over every little detail? Sometimes he just keeps describing something for so long, my head starts to hurt and I keep losing my place or reading the same sentence over and over again. His dialogue is bland and there is really no emotion to it. The characters are just as bland as the dialogue. There is no or little character development in this book, despite its size.

Bilbo is famous in the village because once years ago he went away on a long journey and returned rich. No one is quite sure exactly what happened. And no one except those who were on the journey with him knows about the magical ring he brought back with him, that can make him invisible.Bilbo has decided that he wishes to leave his village and get away. So he throws a huge party and at the end of it he simply disappears. He leaves Frodo as his heir and leaves him everything, including the magic ring.Years later Frodo is visited by the wizard Gandalf, who was the one who sent Bilbo on his journey so long ago.

Monk ""CM""",5/16,3.0,1201132800,Underwhelming,"I know this is going to rile the defenders of the novels, but the films were much better. I remember how the ""purists"" were all up in arms when Peter Jackson changed the plots around, involved characters in certain areas, completely deleated others, etc. Well, I have to say, Jackson did a better job in telling Tolkien's work than Tolkien did.Tolkien's problem I think is that he created such a complex fantasy world with so much detail that he spent his whole time telling us about every single minor character and the minute details of every scene and completely forgot to move the plot along.There were times when I was reading this series and I thought, ""wait, wasn't that a part that was pretty big in the movie?"" Such as the Ringwraith's attack on Weathertop or the battle of Helms Deep. These events were described with as much emotion and excitement as if Tolkien were describing his morning routine.And I ended up groaning when one of his characters would launch into a long speech about how he ended up somewhere or especially when one of the Hobbits would talk about the Shire. At one point in ""The Two Towers,"" Gandalf actually warns Theodan NOT to bring up such topics...I wonder if Tolkien himself even figured out he was spending too much time on these pointless back stories.Don't get me wrong, I love reading books that are rich in depth but this is a bit too deep.Then there are the songs and poems which are nice but...I stopped reading them after a while and went on with the story.The entire premise of the Lord of the Rings was supposed to be a conflict of good vs. evil and trying to stop evil from obtaining the one ring. Sadly, much of the book is devoted to telling us how these Elves ended up here and what happened at these ruins and who was there...again, all stuff that probably would have been better in a companion piece rather than clumsily put into the story like a concrete roadblock.The plot itself was also odd. Now I understand that Tolkien wanted to publish his work all in one giant book but was forced to divide it up. The man obviously doesn't know about climax and plot resolution and this is where Peter Jackson came in. The end of the first book just ends...Frodo dissappears and the rest of the fellowship are looking for him. The beginning of the second book starts with Aragorn finding a mortally wounded Boromir; we don't even get to read about the heroic stand of Boromir, just that he fought well but was overpowered. For the first half of The Fellowship of the Ring, we get to learn more than we cared to know about the Shire and the journey to leave the Shire and the surrounding area is just painfully slow with little or no action at all...just a long history lesson about these woods or this hedge or that village....ughhIn The Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas while the second half is solely devoted to Sam and Frodo.I don't know, Tolkien could have worked the plotline better concerning this and made it more enjoyable. Maybe he got lost in his own world as writers sometimes do and they forgot what the reader doesn't know.As for character development...there is none. The Aragorn you meet halfway through the first book is the same Aragorn that you see crowned as king at the end of the story. Whereas in the film, he is a conflicted man, unsure about his destiny and forced to decide. The characters in the book are one dimensional and you sometimes forget they are even there.I'll say it again, the films were much better or atleast the story was told better by Jackson than by Tolkien. Had Jackson been totally true to the story, we'd still be watching the movies I write this because every single back story would have to be told and the dozens of minor characters would have to be introduced and so on and so forth. In my mind, the movies are how Tolkien would have wanted his story told.

Couple weeks ago, while I was browsing idly around a bookstore, thinking whether I should go for the classics or something new, then I saw this book MIDDLESEX sitting right in front of me... and that's when I came across a truely ""modern classic"".I thought it was simply about the life of a hermaphrodite (Callie), but it surprised me by presenting the lives of three full generations (hence the big book). To be honest, I was a little disappointed at first when the book went in detail about the grandparents, because I was eager to read about Callie's life. But at the end, it worked out so perfectly at making me fall in love with everyone in the family. I felt sad when the grandparents began to age, because I saw them young and vigorous once; worried for the dad when he struggled for his once glamorous diner; and finally, heartborken for Callie when he found out his identity.By the end of the book, instead of thinking about nature vs. nurture, or those old questions about sexual orientation, sin or not sin, marry or no you can't... I thought about life. Yours and mine, what makes it worthwhile, what makes it dispensable; what makes you superior, as to me, what some may call a sinner. And I looked at Callie and realized that it is what you think about your life. Gay, straight, or both, if you like yourself, who has the right to say otherwise? The church? The president? The judge? (who's going to judge the judge?) I don't think so.Callie, the hermaphrodite, the outcast, the doomed, said ""I like my life""and I smiled, thinking the same about my life......""I'm going to have a good life"" The words are so simple, but the world went away...",['Jeffrey Eugenides'],['Fiction']

The under-story of the Greek family coming to America and ultimately 'breaking into' Grosse Pointe, where cultural diversity causes fainting spells among conservative residents, provides the symphonic background for the main character's coming of age in a cross gender body ... which is no less dismaying to its owner. The latter story fits inside the former as neat as a Russian nesting doll. Whether this was intentional on the part of Eugenides, or just part of his genius, I don't know, but the eccentric story is framed so precisely it is never sensationalized. The guy can write - bright, fast, audacious; he does impossible things. Reading this book is like watching gymnastics at the Olympics. If this were music, it would be Mozart.

Much of the story occurs before the narrator is even born, a la _Tristram Shandy_ (one of my favorite novels). But _Middlesex_ covers a whole spectrum of twentieth-century life from intersexuality to the immigrant experience (specifically Greek immigrants) to the founding of the Nation of Islam to incredibly complex extended family relationships to love/lust/desire to self-delusion and deliberate lies to the arrogance of certain members of the medical profession to self-discovery from many different angles.It's not always a comfortable read for those who tend to see gender as a social construct more than a biologically essentialist reality, but it is an excellent reminder of the complexity of both sex *and* gender and that no one explanation for the causes of gender identity or sexual orientation can be generalized to apply to all individuals.As a narrator, Cal is both wryly merciless and wryly sympathetic with his(?) earlier self and with the members of his family and the other characters, and even the most apparently stereotypical characters keep surprising us.

You can tell by the first few pages that he's got a very keen way with words. However, i felt--many times throughout the novel--that his love for beautifully strung words overpowers his storytelling. 100 pages, even 200 pages of details and quirky anecdotes and comparisons, I can handle. But this book is a honkin' 500 page (ish) saga. It spans three generations, and it's a lot of detail that Eugenides packs in. Yes, the story is great. It's a feat. I'll give it that. I can only hope to write half as well as Eugenides, but humility aside, i couldn't get over some of the slower bits, namely Milton and Tessie's story.

But once Callie hits puberty, things pick up, and from that point on i was pretty happily engaged in the story.Overall, i give this book a 3--although i'd really like to give it a 3.5--because of the sheer wordiness of many of the sentences (i grew disinterested) and the creeping boredom that struck during the middle section (as mentioned: Milton and Tessie.)

B000TKO3EA,Middlesex [Unabridged Audiobook],,A39LO2MPCWS4EO,Jeffrey C. Zoerner,17/24,3.0,1184112000,It was the best of books; it was the worst of books,"This is really two books, one a family history, the other a personal narrative. The first one is insufferably bad; two stars out of five at best. The second one is good, perhaps four and a half stars. I suspect that a considerable amount of time separated the writing of the two portions, and that the second half was written first.THE BAD:The plot of the first part (and really of the second, although that is more forgivable, given the subject matter) consists solely of a Forrest Gump-ian series of highly improbable occurrences which, like the Gump movie, tie the main characters into every significant event of the era.To make sure you realize the rich ethnicity of his story, Eugenides gives his characters preposterous, annoying names: Desdemona, Eleutherios (in fairness, this one goes by Lefty), and my personal un-favorite, Sourmelina. In the event that some wise-guy decides to post a comment that these are in fact run-of-the-mill Greek names, know that there is also an American black character named Marius Wyxzewixard Challouehliczilczese Grimes. Jesus! (And of course, why explain to the reader why the brother is named Chapter Eleven? The name is so witty and charming just the way it is.)More painful is the writing style itself. I have never encountered such a self-conscious, self-centered, overwritten style in actual print. If the author were writing this for a junior college creative writing class, the pages would be returned with 80% of the content crossed out.Never in the history of third person narration has there ever been such rampant use of first person pronouns: I, me, my, mine, I, me, me, me. Since Eugenides is telling his family history, some of this is necessary. But Eugenides' desire to place himself at the center of all things pushes this WAY over the top. Just shut up and tell the story! His incessant first person pontificating drags things out five times longer than need be and is just plain annoying.From p. 206, describing secret activity that occurred before the narrator was born: ""Only I, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on."" SHUT UP!!! If you can read this kind of comment over and over for almost 300 pages without wanting to kill the author several times along the way, you are a better person than I.The worst part of all of this is that, amidst all this prose, you never really feel that you know the characters. Their actions are inconsistently motivated; their dialog stilted in order to accommodate Eugenides' endless side commentary. They have been elaborately built up but never actually revealed.Lastly, in his quest to establish himself as the apex of the universe, Eugenides makes an offensive claim about the Nation of Islam which, if made about a larger or more powerful faith, would rightly be met with widespread condemnation. Shame on you, Eugenides.THE GOOD:Really, we read this book to learn about the life of a hermaphrodite, and on that front Eugenides acquits himself quite well. The writing in the second half of the book ranged from mildly annoying to profound and moving. His rampant egocentricism is fitting here, since the narration is now appropriately in the first person, and, at last, he is finally talking about himself.Many of the comments on Amazon, as well as from people I know who have read the book, express that the end portion of the book goes a bit long. I completely disagree. First of all, I would think that people who could people slug their way through the first 270 or so pages of this book would be able to tolerate anything. Secondly, the plot follows a natural progression of what might happen to someone in the position of the book's protagonist.Indeed, if you have reservations about reading this book, you'd do better to fear the first half than the ending. Sure, the last mile of the marathon may be the hardest, but it was really the hills in the first part that got you. It's a toss-up whether to recommend this book; your reading sensibilities have to take a horrific sustained beating before you get to the good part. I guess if I could make it to the end, anyone could. But boy, did that first half suck.",['Jeffrey Eugenides'],['Fiction']

If I had paid better attention to the back of the book I probably would not have felt like I was trudging through it for the first 250 pages. It is an epic novel spanning 80 years and three generations - NOT at all a simple voyeuristic telling of an extremely small percentage of people with a genetic disorder.I was impressed with Mr. Eugenides' ability to make this reader sympathetic toward the narrator's incestuous grandparents, and the depths in which he went to completely and artfully portray the much-needed ""back-story"" to Calliope/Cal's genetic history. However, I often found myself distracted by his eloquent prose, sentence structure and $100 words. This novel requires a dedicated reader willing to take the time and thoughtfulness needed to truly absorb and enjoy it.I was disappointed with how quickly the story wrapped up. Granted, I chose the book because I was expecting more of Calliope and less of her family history, but by the time I finally got to the part I was looking forward to, it flew by, then came to an abrupt, albeit poetic, end.

In order to give the full picture of her/his life Cal, now 41, starts the narration of his tale where it all began, high on the slopes of Mount Olympus in Asia Minor in the summer of 1922. Cal's grandmother Desdemona, works in her silkworm cocoonery and has a premonition of death. The Turks are about to invade Greece forcing Desdemona and her brother Lefty to flee the city of Smyrna.......This was an interesting telling of the story of an unusual character. After a brief introduction by the narrator you are given the origin story involving Calliope's grandparents and a brief telling of the story of her/his parents.

This book isn't for everyone of course. It isn't full of action or adventures so don't go in expecting that.The good: The story overall was very interesting. The characters were well developed.

Broaching the somewhat sensitive medical subject of hermaphroditism and related genetic anomalies, the reader's imagination is encouraged to assume that ""this is what it must be like,"" to be born a girl and a boy. Calliope/Cal is such an attractive, funny, intelligent person. His adolescent love for the Obscure Object (talk about a male expression), his personal Aphrodite, is rich in plaintive desire.

Oliveira""",2/3,5.0,1208044800,Jeffrey Eugenides proves that he is no fluke,"When Jeffrey Eugenides dazzled us with his first novel `The Virgin Suicides' in 1993, we didn't know what expect next. Would he be able to produce another novel as lyrical and dreamy as his debut? Or was he another fluke, a one-book wirter?It took almost ten years, but it was worth waiting. His follow up is as good as `Virgins', if not even better. `Middlesex' is many things but an ordinary story. At first level it is the story of a hermaphrodite discovering his/her body and trying to cope with it. The novel is also a vast panorama of the story of the XX Century, showing events such as the genocide in Greece, the first days of Ford Motors, the Prohibition era and the 1967 race riots -not forgetting to mention life in the pos-wall Berlin.History epic aside, `Middlesex' is also a personal journey of a human being trying to figure out what he is doing in the world, what life means, where we are being led to. Callie -and Cal later on- has many questions, and no answers, and she is not even aware where to find them. She knows she is different, but she doesn't know that extension of that.The first person narrative brings power to the novel. Callie's voice is beautiful and said at the same time. Her family -with no surprise- is what brings her together. Even when she is not with them. At a certain point, one must run away from his/her family in order to understand his/her origins. And this is exactly what happens to Callie/Cal. In a level this book is a coming-of-age tale -a very very different one, but still a novel about becoming an adult, and leaving behind all you used to believe as a child.Somehow, this is an extension to what he worked with in `Virgin'. We will never forget that dialogue between a shrink and one of the girls, when he asks why she tried to kill herself, she didn't even know how hard life can be. And her smart answer is that he had never been a 13 year-old girl.Eugenides make no concessions. The novel has a sad tone -despite some funny parts. The lesson we learn is `life is no easy'. And we have to struggle to survive. Not many writers have the courage to write like that.

It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out.",['Ray Bradbury'],['Book burning']

It paled compared to Something Wicked This Way Comes, but overall, it was fine. I was glad that I could say I read it, even if it failed to provoke a strong reaction from me.So, it's now been about a dozen years since that first reading, and I found myself needing to reread it because some of my students are reading it. So, I started it one evening and had it done by the next. Normally, I don't get anything read that quickly, what with work to go to and papers to grade, etc. But this time, Fahrenheit 451 was something that I could more than appreciate. It hooked me.
